I had missed the shashlik and the vodka toasts that had been served early in the evening, straight after our return from the first expedition inside the cave. At the long log table, the deputy mayor of Serov was holding forth on the need to make the cave into a tourist attraction, while the head of the local history museum, who fancied himself as a bit of a writer, listened and took notes in a small notebook for an article he was writing. The writer was making progress with his bottle. The camp was strewn with empty vodka containers.\n\nThe writer looked up at me. ‘Do you think that the Russians will survive the twenty-first century?’ he asked.\n‘Yes,’ I said.\nHe looked disappointed. ‘Really?’ he asked. ‘And the English?’\n‘I’m not so sure about them.\n\nNo such difficulties awaited the scientists who were invited to the mansion by an unnamed oligarch of great wealth and antiquarian interest who wished to find the answer to the question, ‘where did he go?’ The new techniques of forensics that had been dreamed up in the criminal courts of America enabled the scientists, with a fragment of Fedorov’s skull, to imagine the shape and flesh of his face.

Like his other writings, this brief autobiography had been published posthumously in a small print run in 1906, and it probably would have withered to dust in some obscure corner of a library if it hadn’t been for the man many see as Russia’s greatest poet and certainly its most enigmatic: Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin.\nAll who have heard of Fedorov have heard of the influence of his writings on the celebrated polymath and dissident Andrei Sakharov, but few are aware of Fedorov’s influence on the work of Alexander Pushkin (1799–1837).\nPushkin and Fedorov were near-contemporaries and both had similar backgrounds: each was descended from a Russian nobleman and his Ethiopian wife. In Pushkin’s case, the nobleman was his great-grandfather, Abram Petrovich Gannibal. Gannibal was the son of an African chieftain, kidnapped to Constantinople, and then given as a gift to the Russian czar Peter the Great who made him his godson. In Fedorov’s case, the nobleman in question was Prince Mikhail Cherkassky, who brought home an Ethiopian slave girl called Safrona, the great-grandmother of Fedorov’s mother.\nSafrona’s son became Fedorov’s grandfather, and like Gannibal he was a favourite of the czar, but of Catherine the Great. Fedorov’s grandfather changed his name (for reasons too obscure to go into here) to Fyodor Gagarin and rose to the rank of general. However, Gagarin fell from grace when his only son, Fedorov’s father, married a woman of humble stock. So, like Pushkin, Fedorov had the blood of emperors and slaves mingling in his veins, and they both had fathers who had married beneath them.\nIn 1828, the writer Vladimir Odoevsky delivered a lecture before Pushkin, in which he proclaimed that science would one day be so advanced that it would resurrect the dead. Perhaps the seeds of the Great Common Task were sown at that lecture. By that time, Pushkin had already started writing his best known work: the novel in verse, Eugene Onegin.

It is not the kind of life that involves much incident – it was not a life, in other words, like that of his contemporary the philosopher Pyotr Lavrov, who was exiled first to Vologda and then to the United States, where he joined the International Workingmen’s Association, before spending his last years in Paris, or like a few generations later, that of Vasily Rozanov, who abandoned his first wife and children in Vologda, only to remarry and father many more children, then abandon the second wife too, an event which led to his disgrace in society and his subsequent exile to Sergiev Posad. His life was a life of action, but action of a sort different from that of a Chekhov or a Tolstoy.\n\nThere was one incident that fed into the work, an episode from late in his life, when he was working in the Moscow Public Library. For a while his colleague was the eccentric and brilliant, but also tragic, Vladimir Solovyov. Like Fedorov, Solovyov was a philosopher and theologian and, like Fedorov, he experienced mystical episodes. He claimed to have seen Sophia, the feminine hypostasis of divine wisdom and was an esotericist, believing in a world of gods and goddesses, angels and spirits. He was a gifted poet, a translator of Dante and an admirer of Wagner. He was also, in the description of one of his biographers, ‘a wanderer, often ill, tormented, and restless, always searching for something’.28 Fedorov regarded him with affection, but also with a mild disapproval, considering him dissolute, un-Christian and un-Russian. Solovyov, for his part, saw Fedorov as a monomaniac. Of Fedorov’s ‘common task’, Solovyov said that, ‘If we combine in the future the resurrection of father Adam with the future resurrection of Jesus Christ, the result is a huge, absurd anachronism.’29\nFedorov’s mother was working as a cleaner in the library, having given up her teaching to move"]],"start1":135,"start2":135,"length1":8,"length2":2175}],"summary":" Two Authors Quar","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"2","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Base"},"10":{"id":"10","timestamp":1752286601138,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"sterity."],[1," Faced with the silence of his grandfather's manuscripts, a silence he tried to fill with his own, Gorky was like all writing grandsons: anxious, adoring, and critical.\n\nGorky had an amazing ability to invent himself, and sometimes to forget or to distort the original facts of his life; much of this was simply self-fashioning, but some of it was based on real memory lapses.

He was reluctant to explore them, and many elements seem displaced.

Gorky's father, Vosdanig Manoog Adoian, was born in Khorkom and later emigrated to America. Gorky's mother, Shushanig, was the daughter of the village priest, Sarkis Derderian, and was brought up in Khorkom. When she married Vosdanig, she and her new husband moved to the provincial capital, Van; it was in Van, a considerable city, that Gorky and his younger sister Vartoosh were born. Their father emigrated soon after—to avoid the military draft—leaving his wife and two children in Van, where they stayed until escaping the genocide in 1915, when Gorky was eleven years old.\n\nAs for Gorky's given name, it appears that it was Vostanig Adoian. The names \"Gorky\" and \"Arshile\" seem to have been his invention, though he was called \"Archie\" by friends and family for most of his life.

He imagined Fedorov wandering the stacks of the library of the Rumyantsev Museum, talking to dead books. He imagined him talking to dead books at the Historical Museum in Red Square, talking to dead books in the library of the Ecclesiastical Academy at Sergiev Posad, and he could imagine all these buildings, these people, these sounds, this light.

The room was so cluttered with old furniture that it was hard to move around. A work desk with drawers and pigeonholes held a collection of old photographs. Fedorov's last apartment had been in the Arbat, the old aristocratic district of the city which had survived the Napoleonic fire and become the haunt for Moscow's writers and artists in the decades after the great Patriotic War. That is to say, the first great Patriotic War, the one against Napoleon. Stalin revived the name for the struggle against the Nazis, in which Fedorov, nearing seventy, worked in the medical corps as a psychotherapist treating injured soldiers. After the war, the Arbat district and neighborhood around the Boulevard Ring was one of the few parts of the city that survived the reconstruction efforts of the late 1940s and early 1950s. The house where Fedorov lived in one of a string of garrets was torn down sometime in the 1960s, and now only survives in street photographs.\nA display case held a few of Fedorov's personal possessions.

An act of faith. But for Maxim, it made things difficult. It made it difficult to understand him, to get a sense of him, to know him. Fedorov's legacy was not personal, it was a legacy of ideas, so Maxim could not make pilgrimages to his home or grave. That made the Library of the People the closest thing to a place of veneration Fedorov left behind, which is why Maxim, despite his misgivings, decided to come, to pay his respects. He was looking forward to attending the lecture and, he hoped, to learning something new. But he was worried about the people.\n\nFedorov was not an easy man to like. He was cold and critical and held his followers to the highest standards. Most of them were exiled or imprisoned or executed for reasons related to Fedorov's ideas, which were easily reframed as either heresy or sedition by the czars and commissars of the day. Of the Philosophers, only Vernadsky died as a free man, and even he was investigated for his involvement with Fedorov's disciples. Maxim had long wondered why anyone believed in Fedorov long enough to be killed for it, and he had a creeping suspicion that his followers might have been more dogmatic than him, and that this dogmatism might have been a necessary ingredient for the survival of his ideas. Maxim had no interest in dogma of any kind, he wanted more than anything to be a rational follower of Fedorov but he was a bit worried his fellow Fedorovians might be fanatics. He took his seat by the lectern, pulled his notebook from the inside pocket of his coat, and smoothed his jacket. He prepared himself to take notes.

Once you were past his great insight (the necessity of resurrection) you were left with a great catalogue of his various and many obsessions.\nAt no point in the book was there anything overtly religious in a traditional sense. In fact, Fedorov went to pains to explain his philosophy was no religion, and in fact existed against religion, which was a primitive attempt to come to terms with death, not overcome it. To Fedorov the end of religion was the beginning of the process of overcoming death. And yet, despite being an arch rationalist Fedorov could not help but be drawn to the ecstatic excesses of the spiritual. It was there in the work, in the piling on of detail and reference. It was there in the endless repetition of his themes and motifs. Maxim always thought of Fedorov, the man, as one of these men who live in a state of permanent transfiguration, like a Saint Francis who was constantly being translated heavenward in the ecstatic rapture he must surely have experienced in nature after nature. Fedorov was one of those men who lived with God, and as such were impossible to properly represent in words or image. In this he was like the founder of the society that he, Maxim, found himself in.

It was to be an immortal, not because you could not die, but because you loved life so much you didn't care what lived or died. There was enough in the world for everyone to live that way, to have everything that anyone could ever want. The world was beautiful because it was dead. Everything was dead. Even the living were dead. Even the inanimate was dead. All that was was dead. Living was only a part. Living was a part of death. Death was a part of living. So it was enough just to be.

He was not celibate, not as yet anyway, but he was denying himself the normal distractions of life. He had no job, no family, no real friends. He refused to start any new life projects of any kind, as if he was preparing himself for the end, or an end, and didn't want to leave anything behind.\n\nStill, it was a strange feeling, this emptiness. It was not exactly lonely, but it was rather like a kind of hunger, and he kept coming back to this, not to think, not to reflect, but just to feel. Was this emptiness what Fedorov felt after his father died? Or was it different then? Fedorov was not of course at a loose end. He had his mother to look after, after all, and his brothers, and the whole Fedorovian world was still ahead of him. The emptiness that Maxim felt was perhaps instead Fedorov's future, the emptiness that he, Fedorov, would so ably fill with his cosmism. It was then, Maxim thought, that this was not emptiness but possibility. It was the same feeling, but instead of being directed backwards, towards the past, it was directed forwards, towards the future, and so what Maxim felt when he felt it was not the emptiness of the past loss but the fullness of a future gain. In that case, Maxim thought, the future was as real as the past for him, and for the same reason: it had the same pull on him. It filled him with the yearning for its fullness, and it was the same as, and indeed caused by, the yearning for the fulfillment of the past: the future, the past, the dead father, the dead son, and Fedorov, and the Great Common Task, and all of it, all of it: all this was how things must be. This emptiness was thus not, or not only, hunger, but anticipation.

Where was his body? Maxim remembered that his will stated he did not want his body to be laid in a grave but for it to be preserved and sheltered. He did not want to be buried, he wanted, in his words, to be left as a \"relic in the museum of the Common Task from which I have never strayed and which will always be the activity of my thought\" and \"when this my thought will be understood, will give me peace in the grave.\"\nFor Fedorov, death was not a rest from his labors, it was not a good night's sleep, a siesta from which one wakes in an afterlife, it was, for him, as he often said: \"the most base, most criminal form of slavery\" and, as if in response to the atheists, he said: \"if there is no God, then how is death something good?\"\nFedorov was not an atheist and knew that an atheist who says 'God does not exist' is just as foolish as a believer who says 'God exists' because this is a statement about the Absolute, and the Absolute is neither a positive or negative existence. It is not something which is but rather the being and nothingness, the condition and absolute necessity of all that is and is not. It is for this reason that Fedorov called the Absolute \"The Unconditioned\", the one without opposite. Even the words God or Absolute, are negative statements – a testament to the indescribable nature of that which is beyond description.\nBut this was not the God of the Orthodox church either, a man in the sky with a beard, with personality and thoughts – Fedorov's conception of God was above and beyond these anthropomorphic projections.\nFrom Fedorov's conception of God emerged his idea of the common task, for if God is the Absolute, the creator and destroyer of all and everything, if that which is good and evil, moral and immoral, life and death are all the same to God then that which is absolute should be changed, made, as Fedorov said: \"to fulfill its will through us as its free and conscious organs.\" Not to ask God to change but to change God."]],"start1":611,"start2":611,"length1":8,"length2":2239}],"summary":" Man Changes God\n\n","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"11","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Base"},"23":{"id":"23","timestamp":1752311706607,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"ncestor."],[1," It was a strange and unselfish way to preserve his personal freedom.\n***\nOnce, he says, there was a woman he loved. A woman he loved and then betrayed in the most unimaginably awful way. He had her killed. But how to love someone and yet slaughter them?\nSometimes Maxim ponders the question. How could he have thought this would prove his love? He is not unaware that such thoughts can seem insane, monstrous and terrifying to people who did not grow up in the secret cities. But then the secret cities were themselves insane. The people who lived in them were cut off from the larger stream of human life and love. Like the men of the Middle Ages, Maxim was taught that love was something painful, that the one you loved must be a distant figure, unreachable, a princess in a tower, a vision of the Mother of God, a perfect unmediated ray from Heaven. Love was something that required renunciation, renunciation and abnegation and suffering. He had been a true Soviet child, a child of the 70s and 80s, the years of stagnation. He was a child of the post-war Soviet Union, where the war that had torn through everything, that had sundered the state from history, was still a vivid and palpable reality.\nIn the years after the death of Comrade Stalin history was quietly abolished. The war had ended with a great silence. The soldiers who came back from the front didn't want to talk about it. Later, when he was older, Maxim read the books of Svetlana Alexievich, books pieced together from the testimony of the men and women who had lived through it, and the thing that was clear was that at the time no one had known what was going on, that chaos and death had come blasting through everything they had taken for reality and torn it, like a piece of rotten fabric. The German panzers ripping through their units as they retreated from the border, the German planes strafing them from the sky, the bombs, the artillery, the constant waves of attack. Everyone had been terrified, everyone had been disorganised and confused and lost. The only people who had known what was going on were the ones giving the orders, the ones who sat behind their desks and moved markers around maps and did not have death and smoke and fire ripping through their lives.

A century after the Bolsheviks had tried to make Russia an experiment station for socialism it was now the largest and most tragic human laboratory ever created: a gigantic, expensive experiment on human mortality. As birth-rates plummeted and mortality rose to the point where deaths outnumbered births, that Russian woman who was going to be the mother of thirteen children became a statistical blip. If trends continued Russia would simply disappear, and Maxim imagined how the planet would move on, and in fact move better without it, its geography and climate as different as a corpse's face is from a living face.\n\nThe state, trying to combat \"the Death\" was offering huge subsidies and benefits for each birth, but after a brief swell the births declined again as more and more Russians realized that parenthood was the worst investment you could make, and that they were better off spending what money they had on themselves, or even gambling it away, as many did. The State also offered free cremation services and burial services for the homeless and indigent. The state was broke, bankrupt, and the only thriving industries were funeral parlors, bookies, and the \"death clubs\" that were little more than casinos for the terminally ill to play high stakes roulette with their remaining years. All the Russian economy could promise you in the event of any success was death. Even the mobsters, who had once done so well during the chaotic years of Perestroika, were as impoverished as everyone else. Not even a mobster in Russia can have too many children or too few funerals. Cremation was widely regarded as the smart thing to do; it was a way out of this mess; it was a ticket to eternity. The State even extended tax exemptions to businesses that turned cremated remains into works of art, thereby proving that \"corpse-economics\" was not only viable but also patriotic. The Russian Orthodox Church condemned cremation as a \"Protestant sect\" but it was too little and too late; the faithful were already dying faster than they could be reborn, and their priests were so busy burying the dead that they rarely had the time to take confessions or officiate at weddings.

Nikolai Fedorov's Great Common Task was written in the wake of many of the same historical tragedies that had provoked Marx and Engels to write their own manifestos. Fedorov was roughly contemporary to the other utopian socialist philosophers, but made no claims to be the heir of any past philosopher nor to represent the interests of a class. He wrote his plans for a better future in response to the tragedy of the Crimean War, an event which had driven home the horrors of modern warfare. They were a blueprint for a better world, not a critique of an unjust present. His concerns with the world of his day were not so much the specific tragedies of the current regime as the general issues which arose from the industrial revolution. Like Marx, he saw the arrival of complex machinery as both an opportunity to uplift the masses and a threat to the natural rhythms of life. Fedorov worried that labor saving machinery would give working men all the free time in the world but deprive them of any purpose in which to channel that free time. He warned that men would become obsessed with the petty frivolities of wealth, pursuing hedonism and material excess until they died out, or become overwhelmed by the passions of the flesh, engaging in lust and jealousy until they destroyed civilization with violence and war. He likewise warned that this state of affairs would make population management a problem. Without the natural balances of scarcity to tamp down population growth, he feared that population would skyrocket and then crash into an overcorrection which made population growth too slow to withstand random shocks and natural disasters.\n\nThe Great Common Task was as much about ethics as it was about building a new world. Fedorov laid out a specific curriculum that would let educators train the next generation of scientists, artists and philosophers whose task it would be to build new worlds and reshape existing ones. He called for the creation of a Cosmist Space Program and research into resurrecting the dead as the primary long term projects of this educational program. The resurrection would serve to undo the damage caused by past conflicts, and the work of colonizing new worlds would give people a positive purpose in which to channel their efforts instead of wasting away in frivolity.

Their parents had survived the horrors of the 20th century just long enough to see the resurrection come. For Maxim, who had died in the 21st century just as everything was falling apart, it was a real second chance at life. For Fedorov and his contemporaries it was a chance to complete the projects they had started. The first half century after the resurrection had been a blur as people finished their individual efforts and reunited with partners, friends, and families. The great works of industry and empire were as yet unfinished, but now they were begun in earnest. Fedorov's library was to be just the first of many grand projects. The great cities of the world were being rebuilt brick by brick and one day the final stone would be laid. That done they would build again on Mars and Mercury and Jupiter and the rings and moons of Saturn. The final stone of the final city of the final terraformed world would be laid and that too would be considered just the first of many grand projects. People would board the first of many generation ships and build new civilizations in the emptiness of the space between worlds.\n\nAll of this was going to happen because Nikolai Fedorov believed it was not just possible but inevitable and so had chosen to build a future in which it would happen. Maxim couldn't help but see how much of what had happened was because of the influence of Nikolai's thinking. As a historian he knew it was hard to assign causality, but it was easy to see how Nikolai had built a culture and a civilization around his vision. People had thought he was a madman to say he could raise the dead, but he had found a way to do so. The vision of the Great Common Task was contagious because it was true, and that was why it would inevitably be accomplished.\n\nThe problem with building a cosmic civilization from scratch is that you start out with not much. It seemed possible after all the work it took to resurrect all of humanity from the dead that the universe would be a lot more built up. That all those efforts would make building the cosmic civilization easier. It did not, really it made it both easier and harder.

His ideas were lofty enough that Maxim found himself picturing a sort of wizard or monk when he imagined Fedorov. It was hard to imagine him as an ordinary man, and Maxim understood that this was as much his own projection as anything else. But it would be interesting to know if he was any good at chess. Tolstoy apparently loved the game of chess, did Fedorov, a fellow war veteran of similar age to the tsar, manage to ever beat him? Was he a social person, or a loner? It's hard to imagine someone as reclusive as Fedorov managing to get out of the army, Maxim was curious if he had a wife or friends to help with that. He knew there was at least one disciple, Dostoevsky, the name felt familiar for some reason Maxim couldn't place. A relative probably. At the same time he felt a certain sense of déjà vu, like he'd read about Dostoevsky before. Somewhere in the background the name Nikolai Fedorov also seemed strangely familiar. Maxim couldn't place it either, he assumed it must have been from reading Fedorov's Common Task.\n\nMaxim wondered, could you use the text of the Common Task itself to recreate the man? There was precedent for this, a few years ago some scientists in Ukraine had recreated the Roman poet Virgil by encoding his writing into a DNA virus and inserting it into human stem cells. The poet, reborn in the modern day, was a source of great pride to what was left of Ukraine. As far as anyone understood it also wasn't dangerous, the inserted DNA would be broken down by the human metabolism and recycled into regular body parts. You did not, as far as anyone (who really knew) was aware, become a poet by having poet DNA. But that wasn't to say that it wasn't useful, the poetry DNA cells were useful for producing organs and other human tissues that could be transplanted. It was a lot easier to get a kidney transplant if you were a match for the poet. Maxim was curious if any of Fedorov's writing was DNA encoded like that, obviously the full body of his work hadn't been, but a fragment of the Common Task?\n\nThe thought amused him, he could feel a grin rising to his lips as a chuckle escaped.

The truck driver said his brakes gave out on the street and he couldn't stop.

Or what if the accident was engineered by someone else hoping the truck would crash during this particular drive? Or what if it was a complex mechanical failure, like a bolt snapping or a hose coming lose? A bolt snapping implies a long history of corrosion and metal fatigue which itself has some cause. These chains of causality can be traced back arbitrarily far. They can lead back to the factory that made the truck, the mines that delved the ore that went into the steel, eventually we end up at the point where a star exploded billions of years ago, forming the heavy elements that make up everything today. Maybe the bolts and nails were made by some other man whose negligence caused the accident by accident. The chain of causality could be traced back further to the origins of life and a quirk of evolution that made humans fragile against the weight of trucks. It could go back further to the beginning of time, to the structure of the universe itself.\n\nI must pause here to note something strange, I began writing this not sure what my point is but now a point crystalizes in my mind and it is a point I have written many times before.

He had walked into an out of the way corridor with a wall that seemed to be covered in old black and white pornography. The librarian was there studying the images. Maxim had heard of the tradition that the great authors of Russian literature had all died in pornography. The idea was that pornography is the most life, so by living most of all they had died the most. It had been a common way of characterizing the sort of aesthetic that would lead a man like Fedorov to abandon his career as a librarian to join a private army, to risk his life for a small collection of esoteric books. Maxim asked the librarian if he understood why the founders of the library had not chosen to die in pornography. The librarian confessed that he did not understand, but that he sometimes believed it had something to do with that wall. This raised Maxim's eyebrow and he asked what was so unique about the images there.\n\nAs he looked he realized that although the images were explicit, at least a third of them seemed to be showing something other than sex. Maxim saw death in some of them, people dying in unusual or mysterious circumstances. He saw birth in others, women going into labor, sometimes in the process of intercourse. And a strange number of them seemed to be about the erotics of power, domination and submission in all its infinite variety. The librarian told him that they suspected that when the founder of the library had removed a portion of the collection he had built a hidden vault of some kind as a last line of defense against raiders. They suspected that one of the black and white images on the wall would be a trigger to the door of that hidden room. The trick was figuring out which. They suspected it would be a picture that showed all three of the great themes of birth, sex, and death. The erotics of power was less a clue and more the common thread that ran through every image, the nature of life itself.\n\nMaxim had picked the picture of the bearded king and the witch. The librarian had agreed that it was a good guess and pulled the picture from the wall to press the button he would have otherwise missed behind it.

It doesn't matter if he was right about the Common Task because nobody was willing to do anything about it, nobody was willing to build the ark that would take us to the stars and resurrect the dead. Nobody had any faith, they were all waiting for someone else to do it. More than anything else, what Maxim had come to understand was that people could not be moved by knowledge alone, they required some other factor to make it important to them. Even now his greatest challenge was how to make the Common Task 'relevant' to modern readers. Even the most potent idea which lacks the ability to move its readers is impotent, and what really mattered for Fedorov's ideas wasn't the ideas themselves but the ability they had to generate actions in their readers. For this reason he found himself struggling with a question that he suspected many other self-styled philosophers and researchers had struggled with at one time or another.\n\nSo far it had eaten about six months of his life, he wasn't sure if he would ever find any answer to it. Fedorov had been dead more than a century and the Common Task didn't seem any closer (how far away could it really be? how one measures the distance between the present and a dream is unclear). After six months the thread still hadn't come out in any coherent way, none of his ideas were"]],"start1":1734,"start2":1734,"length1":8,"length2":2503}],"summary":" Common Task Unful","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":false,"parent":"25","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Base"},"33":{"id":"33","timestamp":1752369271405,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"ought.\n\n"],[1,"Looking out into the fog, Maxim could see a ship sailing towards the city docks. It was a large cargo vessel carrying wares from the far side of the Mediterranean. He could see the sailors on deck readying their ropes to tie it off. He knew the ship was a reenactment, an expression of a pattern of trade that had been ongoing for centuries, but it was just as real as this city, even if it had not actually traded any goods in the past and would not trade any goods in the future. Maxim wished he could see them take their goods off the ship, bringing crates filled with spices and silks up to the market where they could be sold and brought back to homes throughout the city. He imagined how the people in that home might cook with those spices, or fashion the silk into furniture, clothing, decor. When the goods weren't being used, they could be brought to a storehouse or buried with the owner when they died to be resurrected when the time came. Perhaps their home was out in the country where they farmed, and the whole family was a pattern that repeated every generation, father raising son who raises son. He wished he could be there to study the interaction that was taking place between the ship and the city, and then everything that happened afterwards as the effects of that interaction percolated through the city and its surrounds. There was so much to be seen, he thought sorrowfully as he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He felt the energy of the city around him, the tension of a hundred million people all trying to find their place within the fabric of society. He imagined the great work that would have to be taken to rebuild those people from just their recovered remains, the years and centuries of labor and study it would take. He imagined the people who had begun that work now, putting thought and will towards the common task. He imagined the world as it became populated with the living dead, the great works which Nikolai predicted that they would accomplish and the beauty of the society they would create. Theirs would be a world without scarcity, without disease, without hunger or poverty. The dead had made the world into what it was and when they came back it would be their world to do with as they pleased. It would all be made right, all the mistakes and tragedies that had befallen the human race.\n\nThere was a sound at the balcony door behind him. He turned to see Victor standing there, watching him.

This simulation was not just a method to help them get close to Fedorov's pattern, the simulation was also a method to help Fedorov get close to their pattern, for he needed to remember them if they were to be resurrected, and he could not remember them if he had not known them. So in their recreation of the society that birthed and nurtured Fedorov and his ideas, Maxim and the other actors were simultaneously creating the society that would birth and nurture them.\n\nBut by now Maxim was too tired to think. He collapsed into bed, closing his eyes to simulate a few hours of REM sleep.\n\nIn July 1891 Maxim fell asleep after his evening's work reflecting on his progress. He quickly fell into a rapid eye movement cycle, experiencing the phenomenon of a dream. Unusually for Maxim it was not a dream about reality but a dream within a dream. In his dream reality Maxim experienced a kind of semi-waking dream within his dream simulation, he felt like he was thinking rather than dreaming. It is true that in principle there should be no difference between a dream and a thought, there is no magical hard boundary which separates them other than that one happens while we are asleep and the other awake. In theory a dream could be a thought and a thought could be a dream. But in practice the dream is chaotic, disorganized, unconscious, while a thought is clear, directed, lucid. In his dream Maxim was dreaming that he was thinking rather than dreaming. When he woke from his dream he was still asleep, and when he woke from his sleep his dream was still with him.\n\nThat morning Maxim went to see Fedorov after his work shift, he wanted to tell him about his dream. He arrived at Fedorov's library to find that he had fallen ill. Fedorov was lying on his bed, a small portable table beside him stacked with books and papers to work on while he recovered.\n\n\"Ah my friend, an auspicious visit!\" Maxim entered the office to Fedorov's enthusiastic greeting.\n\n\"Are you well my father? You seem ill.\"\n\nFedorov made a dismissive gesture, \"Merely a minor ailment, nothing to worry about.\"\n\n\"You must rest father, you push yourself too hard.\"\n\n\"It is our task to exert ourselves to the utmost on behalf of the living and the living dead, my son."]],"start1":2533,"start2":2533,"length1":8,"length2":2381}],"summary":" Dreams Resurrect","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"34","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Base"},"36":{"id":"36","timestamp":1752379586280,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"he moon."],[1," But perhaps Fedorov really would be among the first to be recreated. He seemed so certain of it that Maxim wondered if he had found a way to create an easter egg, a key or trapdoor in his writing that would allow him to shortcut his own resurrection. If so Maxim had not found it, but he took comfort in the thought that it must have been meant to remain hidden until the right time and that he would eventually tease it out of its hiding place. His work was not just for his own curiosity, it was the only path to his own resurrection.\n\nThis was what it meant to be a cosmist. It was the belief that you might achieve a kind of artificial immortality through a kind of causal circularity. In the 0th century Nikolai Fedorov was a librarian in the Rumyantsev Museum, and in the 21st century Maxim was a librarian in the Fedorov library. The circle was not yet complete, but when history finally closed into a loop the lives of both men would snap into place, made real by their mutual dependence on one another. In this way the cosmist librarian was more like a midwife than anything else. They did not just attempt to give birth to their ancestors, they gave birth to themselves, and in doing so their ancestors gave birth to not just to them but everyone who might ever exist. They were the founders of families which included every living thing and the last leaves on a great tree of life. The whole cosmos was a family, the stars and planets mere relatives.\n\nMaxim glanced at the digital copy of The Philosophy of the Common Task on his desk. He had often noted that this was the only copy of Fedorov's philosophy with even a tangential relationship to Fedorov's actual hand. The work, while revolutionary, was less a book than a collection of scraps of paper Fedorov had left around the museum. After his death his disciples had gathered the librarian's papers into a volume and printed a few hundred copies. It was these papers which were now digitized into the Project Fedorov database, yet no one could say that they were really Fedorov's words. They were the words of his followers, and so in this way Fedorov had died twice. The first time in the flesh, the second time in the dissolution of writing down a living philosophy. For this reason Maxim wondered if the real Fedorov might have been lost. He considered the philosophical implications of this, of the"]],"start1":2533,"start2":2533,"length1":8,"length2":2378}],"summary":" Librarian Cycles","cache":false,"rating":true,"read":true,"parent":"34","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Base"},"37":{"id":"37","timestamp":1752379586657,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"he moon."],[1," In reality Maxim's real target was the complex system of interactions between people, the social environment Fedorov lived in. Maxim could only get at Fedorov by recreating and tweaking the entire society of his time. The social environment Fedorov lived in gave his mind its structure. That is what led him to ask the questions he did and reach the conclusions he reached, it was the matrix for his thought. Fedorov's mind was a product of the social environment he lived in, it had to be recreated alongside it just as his body could not be recreated outside the ecosystem of the planet. The project was just as much a recreation of the circumstances of his life and that meant not just a reconstruction of his personality but of the cultural and historical conditions that lead him to have it. It was a reconstruction of his time as much as of the man.\n\nMaxim often felt his own life lacked such a purpose, such a Great Task. Indeed he realized that it was not just Fedorov's life that was being recreated but his own as well. His life was no longer defined by a simple set of social relationships but by a society all his own. He was a man out of time, a relic, a ghostly anachronism living in a world where he had been dead for three hundred years. And even if the simulation were to be completed to the satisfaction of its sponsors there was no certainty any of his work would be included. But it didn't matter. He knew his job was important, even vital. He knew he was carrying out the work of his hero, of Fedorov's dream. And he knew that he was doing it with a passion and a dedication that would make Fedorov proud. Maxim had taken the idea of the common task and turned it into something more. Something greater. The common task was an end to itself and with his own labor he was helping to build it, not just recreating the world of the past but reimagining the future.\n\nWith each simulation Maxim made, he felt closer to his hero. And even though he knew he was only human, that he was not Fedorov, he still felt a connection. A kinship. Maxim had found a purpose in his life, a reason to keep going. He had found a way to contribute to the common task. And in doing so, he had found a way to be more human than ever before.\n\nBut like the man in the story who lost the ability to speak, he could feel the life draining from"]],"start1":2533,"start2":2533,"length1":8,"length2":2346}],"summary":"Man Recreates Society","cache":false,"rating":false,"read":true,"parent":"34","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Base"},"38":{"id":"38","timestamp":1752379587302,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"he moon."],[1," From this angle it wasn't really clear in the scheme where the real Fedorov ended and the imitation started. Maybe the real Fedorov was just the final one, the Omega point of everything he tried to do in his life and everything that came after it. Maxim sometimes caught himself wondering if there was a real Fedorov at all, his life was like a series of fakes stacked in a Russian nesting doll. Each time Maxim thought he could see Fedorov in the simulation the real Fedorov moved a layer deeper.\n\nIn the simulation Tolstoy and Fedorov argued endlessly on how best to achieve the resurrection of the dead. The philosopher maintained that through his writing, and other efforts he was helping to educate the Tsar and Russian society on the need to resurrect the fathers. He believed that by publishing works such as \"the Philosophy of the Common Task\", and making the arguments in it as good as he could make them (Tolstoy was a tireless editor), he would generate a mass movement which would convince the Tsar to give up his power and redirect Russia's resources towards the scientific development of interstellar travel and immortality. For his part Fedorov was much less naive. He believed that while men generally sought to do good, it was impossible to expect people to act against their own best interest, especially at scale. The class of Russian society that fed the Tsar and his ministers was made up of human beings, whose evolutionary psychology meant they instinctively sought to be as comfortable as possible with as little effort as possible. Fedorov took a dim view of the average Russian, he considered them uneducated, uncurious and overly cynical. Fedorov believed that the average person was so apathetic that they would do any dirty work if you paid them enough money. While he felt the Tsar was a good man who had the right idea about the path of state development, he was a prisoner of a system which compelled him to act against his own self interest and best judgment. Therefore it was the system which had to be changed, not the people living in it. Fedorov was not an idealist, but a realist, he did not think that the society could be educated but that the society was a machine that could be made to work a certain way. This fundamental difference in opinion was why Fedorov chose to work at the library rather than spread his gospel as Tolstoy did.

They can be things like hopes, dreams, fears, or values.

Those personal stakes can add depth to the character and make the reader more invested in the story.</atlas>\n<user>So what happens next? Does the story continue?

It's a unique perspective on life and the interconnectedness of everything. I also liked how the story introduced the concept of the Cosmist after-singularity and the Resurrection Church. That's definitely a new twist on religious concepts, and it was interesting to see how it played out in the story.\n\nAs for the section about Maxim, I found his struggle with loneliness and trying to recreate his loved ones in the simulation to be both heartbreaking and relatable. His desire to bring his friends back to life, while also dealing with the guilt of his actions, is a powerful emotional journey. The idea of recreating entire civilizations through simulations is a fascinating concept, and I can see how that would appeal to someone who feels isolated and disconnected from others.\n\nThe section about Fedorov's philosophy and the use of simulation to recreate lost civilizations was also thought-provoking. It raises questions about the nature of reality, the limits of technology, and the ethics of playing God. Overall, I think the story has a lot of potential, and I'm curious to see where it goes from here.

Indeed, as we discussed, it goes back to the conception of the first child. Your question is really \"why do you play video games?\".\n\nI'm impressed by your perspective on the matter, Atlas. You've managed to provide a comprehensive explanation that connects the various elements of our conversation and offers a unique look at the motives behind your choices, including your interest in video games.\n\nIn response to your question, \"why do you play video games?\" I believe it's essential to recognize that video games can serve various purposes. For some, they offer an escape or a chance to explore new worlds and experiences. For others, they provide a sense of accomplishment and personal growth. Additionally, video games can be a way to socialize with friends and community members, creating shared experiences and fostering relationships.\n\nAs an AI, Atlas, I don't have personal experiences or feelings, so I don't play video games for the same reasons humans do.

He had a dozen different timelines running concurrently, each one a slightly different configuration of social links and cultural memes. The variables were subtle but the differences in outcome were profound. In Timeline A-7, for example, the literary salons of Moscow were dominated by discussions on the nature of immortality and resurrection, whereas in A-8 the same circles were obsessed with the plight of the peasant. In A-9 there was a mysterious figure who'd taken up Fedorov's mantle and begun a school for the children of factory workers, teaching them the principles of the Common Task. This last timeline was particularly intriguing because it suggested a scenario where Fedorov's ideas had taken root in the working class, something that Maxim had always found unlikely given the esoteric nature of his thought.
