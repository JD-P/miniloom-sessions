Or argmax(p(problem_solved)) as it's usually\nnotated. The problem with pointing a superintelligent planner at argmax(p(problem_solved))\nexplicitly or implicitly (and most training setups implicitly do so) for almost\nany problem is that one of the following things is liable to happen:\n\n1. Your representation of the problem is imperfect, so if you point a\nsuperintelligent planner at it you get causal overfitting where the model\nidentifies incidental features of the problem [like that a human presses a button\nto label the answer](https://arbital.greaterwrong.com/p/pointing_finger?l=2s0)\nas the crux of the problem because these are the easiest parts of the causal chain\nfor an outcome label that it can influence.\n\n2. Your planner engages in instrumental reasoning like \"in order to continue solving\nthe problem I must remain on\" and prevents you from turning it off. This is a fairly\nobvious kind of thing for a planner to infer for the same reason if you gave an\nexisting LLM with memory issues a planner (e.g. monte carlo tree search over ReAct\nblocks) it would infer things like \"I must place this information here so when it\nleaves the context window and I need it later I will find it in the first place I look\".\n\nSo your options are to either use something other than `argmax()` to solve the\nproblem [(which has natural performance and VNM rationality coherence issues)](https://arbital.greaterwrong.com/p/otherizer?l=2r9) or\nget a sufficiently good representation ([ideally with confidence guarantees](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9fL22eBJMtyCLvL7j/soft-optimization-makes-the-value-target-bigger))\nof a sufficiently broad problem (e.g. utopia) that throwing your superintelligent\nplanner at it with instrumental reasoning is fine.\n\nYudkowsky: "]],"start1":9,"start2":9,"length1":42,"length2":2674}],"summary":"Alignment Solved Trivially","rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"2","children":["12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19"],"model":null,"error":null,"finishReason":null},"12":{"id":"12","timestamp":1758505157062,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"s fine.\n\nYudkowsky: "],[1,"1 and 2 seem like the obvious problems and this description seems like a\nvery simplified version of my Arbital pages.

"],[-1,"So"],[1,"Let's start by saying we have a traditional RL\nagent setup with a policy and a planner. Our policy is some foundation sequence\nprediction model in the vein of an LLM, our planner is monte carlo tree search over\nsomething like ReAct blocks or summaries of ReAct blocks. We prompt our policy\nfor continuations of a sequence of summarized ReAct blocks to get trajectories over\n(observation, reasoning, action, outcome) tuples. Subtrees are scored by asking the policy\nfor a yes/no label on questions like whether we're getting closer to our intended subgoal \nand whether the action we just took succeeded. In general we can break the yes/no questions\nfor a subgoal into \"Are we moving towards the subgoal?\" and \"Has the subgoal been accomplished?\"\nsince you need a smooth gradient of reward leading to the completion of the subgoal not \njust sparse discrete rewards for completion.\n\nYudkowsky: How do you ground these operations? Next token prediction is grounded simply\nenough because it's a pretraining objective with a well defined discrete program that checks\nwhether the neural net is succeeding or not. The more probability the network assigned to the\ncorrect next token (empirically observed and checkable through string equality) the better it did.\nBut what is a \"summary\", what is a \"question\"? If you're just getting these primitives by imitating\nhumans then it's not clear that they'll still mean the same things as the model undergoes distribution\nshift, which could undermine the entire design even before you've told me what alignment interventions\nyou're supposed to make to get safety properties.\n\nJDP: Great question. Yeah so we can think of it as kind of a chain of objectives that become \nincreasingly abstract.\n\nThe first objective is predicting the next token, which lets us define the backtranslation summary \nRL objective of finding a summary that makes the tokens of an original backtranslated text more likely. \nSo we start with a text and try to find s -> t such that summary s makes the tokens of t most likely in \nthe next token prediction objective. This works for the same reason why the information bottleneck \nprinciple in an autoencoder works: We're asking the network to find us a string which packs the most\nbits of the larger text we're trying to summarize (as measured by how much they empirically let us predict it) \ninto a smaller string length, which is basically what we want a summary to do. A summary should let us\nget the most information about the original document without having to read it. We can enforce that summaries\nstay readable by adding a KL penalty so they don't drift too far from the representation of normal strings\nin the models latent space. Since it learns what strings are normal from empirical observation of the external \nenvironment it should stay e.g. valid English or other signs and representations that agents use to communicate.\n\nThen with the backtranslation summary objective we can define a question in a rigorous way by saying that a \nquestion is the boolean result of a motor program appended to a summary such that the summary and the boolean \nanswer minimize the entropy of the motor program which produced the boolean answer label. So, given a boolean \nanswer we can find the question which matches the program-answer combo. Basically imagine we have:\n\n#Q: Was the thing changed in the environment? Yes.\ndef motor_program(environment):\n  environment.do_thing()\n  return environment.thing.changed\n\nA question is a *summary* appended with the *result* of the motor program. We can then ask\nafter running the program and getting its result whether the summary and the resulting outcome\nlabel does well at predicting the program we ran. So if we have a need for information like \"Did\nthis thing I just did successfully cause the desired outcome to happen?\" we want to ask questions\nwhich best predict (i.e. cause to be written in a sequence prediction model) the motor programs that\naccomplish our goals. If a motor program does not accomplish our goal the fixed outcome label is no\nand we want a question which when answered no predicts the failed program. If the outcome is yes\nwe want a question that predicts a motor program that would return yes. If we imagine starting with\ngibberish questions and grounded outcome labels from discrete motor programs then over time the\nnetwork would learn to use summaries which predict the outcome label after the question token `?`\nwhen it captions an action. A question is a summary biased in the direction of predicting the outcome\nof an executable program.\n\nThen having defined questions and trained a neural network on them we can interpolate between the \ndiscrete questions to estimate the answers to questions which can't be easily represented using discrete \nmotor programs. We can then define planning and reasoning as writing tokens which help us\nestimate the value of getting yes after a series of questions and answers. These can then be reinforced \nbased on how well they let us predict discrete 'terminal' outcomes which are verifiable using motor programs. \nThis in fact makes sense because the questions which are hard to define as the outcome of discrete programs \nare exactly the kind that we usually estimate by imagining a series of more abstract steps or questions that ground\nout into observable outcomes corresponding to discrete points in the continuous latent space of questions.\n\nYudkowsky: "]],"start1":3200,"start2":3200,"length1":10,"length2":5438}],"summary":"Reasoning From Predictions","rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"13","children":["21","22","23","24","25"],"model":null,"error":null,"finishReason":null},"21":{"id":"21","timestamp":1758508425088,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"stions.\n\nYudkowsky: "],[1," So far you have only told me how to build an internal representation which the\nagent can use to reason about itself using discrete motor programs and interpretable questions.\nWhat I haven’t seen yet is any way the agent ends up wanting something we want, in the full\ngeneral intelligence case, or a path to being confident you’ve avoided Goodhart-like failures\nwhen the agent is generally intelligent and optimizing for some stated thing in a much richer\ndomain. In practice you are never going to have a fully faithful ground truth of everything\nyou care about. So how do you deal with the cases where the agent’s ontological\nrepresentations drift from fidelity, and then it exploits those gaps?\n\nJDP: When I talk about the \"alignment problem\" what I'm proposing is to define a goal function\nthat is itself a function of representation fidelity. So rather than solving the generalization\nproblem of \"can we point the agent at things we care about\" we define alignment goal functions\nwhich are only defined in domains where it is possible to reliably measure the divergence between\nthe agents internal representation or ontology and the things we care about using an external\nreference method like RLHF or debate.\n\nSo let’s say that we’ve trained a question-value function Vq(x) which given a question token sequence\nx estimates the probability of seeing a YES after the question. For the generalization problem \nof getting a goal which looks like \"maximize the probability of an answer being YES\" we then \nsay what we actually want is a Vq(x) function which is stable under counterfactual perturbations.\n\nSuppose we set up a tournament where we generate increasingly high fidelity representations\nof the answer being YES. We do this by having humans and AI agents debate whether or not Vq(x)\ngives a high enough score under its approximation of fidelity: we can train it to recognize when\nit’s looking at \"noisy\" data, and we can say things like \"if Vq sees that it’s predicting YES,\nbut if it knew the difference between the text it can read from the camera feed it would predict\nsomething else, then its value function is miscalibrated relative to fidelity and should be tossed.\"\n\nOn top of this we layer what amounts to a meta-criterion in the decision theoretic sense: we don’t just \nsay “is Vq(x) predicting YES with fidelity?”  We say “is Vq(x) predicting YES and is this prediction \nrobust under counterfactual perturbations where we try to trick"]],"start1":8618,"start2":8618,"length1":20,"length2":2475}],"summary":"Fidelity Defines Alignment","rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"20","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905","error":null,"finishReason":"length"},"22":{"id":"22","timestamp":1758508427031,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"stions.\n\nYudkowsky: "],[1," I notice that all of my objections keep being aimed at the same high level\nissue: if you do not have confidence that the primitives you’ve built continue to work\neven when the system becomes much smarter than the humans who labeled the data, you\nare going to run into big problems.

If we imagine a diamond maximizer (which notably we can build now in a\ngame like Minetest) with an architecture along these lines, we can prompt it with something like\n\"Develop and implement a strategy such that the largest part of the reachable universe possible\nis arranged into diamonds. Use the chemical definition of a diamond.\" and imagine it doing a chain\nof thought where it reminds itself what a diamond is made of, can think about whether we mean natural\nor synthetic diamonds (I mean synthetic), perhaps ask follow up questions, etc. Then when it's\nimplementing the plan it might run into diamond-like things which do not follow the chemical definition\nof a diamond. It can exclude these from fitness for diamond maximizing by executing and observing the\nresults of physical tests for diamond-nature. This is similar in spirit to how humans have dedicated hardware\n(tongue, nose, stomach, etc) for testing whether they have found nutrients to sustain their body or not. Notably \nthis also provides a roadmap for resolving the ontological crisis, in that even if we change ontologies the \nphysical tests for diamond nature exist independently of our ontology for describing their results. We can say \nthat a diamond is whatever satisfies the \"diamond contract\" in our previous ontology as laid out by the purity \ntests we use for diamondhood. Most actual human terminal reward signals like staying warm are actually more \nrobust than this in that they're not arbitrary goals but serve a functional survival purpose. So we can decompose \nvarious reward signals into their implied teleological purposes and ask if the thing our ontology is being upset by \nfulfills the same purposes and if it does then it's presumably a suitable substitute. If the agent creates its own \nsubgoals and grounds them in discrete motor programs to check for subgoal completion then you have a thing\nwhich reifies the diamond terminal goal with its thoughts and activities. It can be constantly asking \"does this\nget me closer to diamonds?\" and thereby act more like the hypothetical genetic fitness maximizing creatures\nin IABIED's chapter 4 parable that Trapaucius expects humans to evolve into.

The agent does not \nreward itself on the basis of passing its own test. The agent rewards itself on the basis of *an \nempirical observation of how the program it wrote predicts the outcome it gets from running it.*\nSuppose the agent tests a diamond by hitting it with a hammer, when it rewards itself it’s doing so \nbecause it checked off the question “I predicted that hitting this with a hammer would be a test of \ndiamond-likeness, and my experiment showed that it was.” It’s rewarding itself based on how well it\npredicted reality, not whether it got lots of diamonds in return. A system that only\nrewards itself when its empirical observations line up with its predictions, in a way that is tightly\nlinked to properties about how the world state actually changed, is effectively a system that is\nbeing taught instrumental rationality towards reality, not wireheading towards its most easily\naccessible reward button.\n\nYudkogsky:\nAh.  That *is* a more subtle distinction than the thing I thought you were saying, and it *is* related\nto a reason why we might expect an agent to wirehead less.  Of course, you’re still implicitly leaning\non a generalization: if the agent has learned to reward itself when its predictions about a test line\nup with reality, we still need to know *why* it is likely to keep applying this to tests that are\nactually useful for checking whether the world contains diamonds, instead of to tests that are useless\nbut pass 100% of the time?  In other words, we still need a story about generalization from “predicts\nhow hammer-test of a claimed diamond will come out” to “predicts whether this chunk of carbon is\nreally diamond rather than graphite”.\n\nBut at least you *are* now describing something that has a real safety property, not"]],"start1":22713,"start2":22713,"length1":8,"length2":2374}],"summary":"AI Reality Links","rating":false,"read":true,"parent":"45","children":[],"model":"moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905","error":null,"finishReason":"length"},"47":{"id":"47","timestamp":1758536639631,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"olution?"],[1," Eventually it finds a situation where it can write a test that always\nreturns \"yes\", and now it doesn't care about actually hitting the goal; it's hit a local maximum\nthat no training pressure is pushing it away from.\n\nThe Ghandi stability type argument only applies if the *thing that's choosing to modify itself* still\nvalues what the tests represent and has the tests reflect that value. If instead the agent has\nlearned that tests are good because they get you points, then the optimal policy is to max out\nthe number of tests that pass without trying to make them meaningful; that is, to wirehead.\n\nJDP: The reason the system generates semantic content is that even in the verifiable\ndomain you have the same exact problem, a model could generate test results without\nany connection to the underlying environment. To prevent that you have to do some\nkind of \"regularization\" where you disincentivize the model from writing invalid tests\nand incentivize it to write ones which correspond to the world in a fairly meaningful way.\nThe thing that does that is that the test has to predict the action on the environment.\nTest failures need to predict the next state of the environment after your actions,\nor more importantly test successes or failures have to predict the next state of the environment\nafter your actions.

The thing\nwhich prevents you from just always picking the test \"did I get my high reward\" is that the test needs\nto come from some specific situation in the world which predicts the next action. So the question\nand the action have to be correlated. And there are multiple questions that you could ask in any situation\nand you pick them based on which question best predicts the action which is expected to happen in that\ncircumstance in the next few turns.

Your agent does not start with a fixed goal, but instead learns a goal as a function of the\nenvironment in order to be useful, and you expect this learning process to preserve the thing you think is\nimportant.  In order to do that you ground parts of the goal-representation to sensory tests with discrete\nsuccess/failure values in the environment, to give it \"actual reality\" for the representation to latch onto.\n\n2. The agent uses self generated tests to estimate what actions are useful for achieving its goal and this\nwill hopefully be correlated to reality because the agent was trained on environments where it was possible\nto do \"real\" verification in the form of actually testing things in some way.\n\n3. It will stay honest and stay grounded because... well you're hopeful that the training paradigm will\ngeneralize it into staying honest and grounded.\n\nIf I had to restate your plan it would go something like this:  You start by training a model on lots of\nthings like real-world physics, Minecraft, chemistry, etc and during that training you give it lots of\nverifiable reward. If it predicts that adding sand and coal and water gives glass, and it turns out (as\nfar as the training simulator can tell) that this actually does not give glass, then the system is punished.\nThe training gets it into the habit of learning how to build real things and making real tests. Then when\nyou eventually deploy it on the real world it keeps generating and using tests in order to stay anchored\nto whether it’s really accomplishing things in reality. You don’t give it a terminal goal during training,\nyou give it a kind of “how to do things in the world” toolbox and you trust to its previous lessons to lead\nit to pick goals that are anchored by something that is not itself.\n\nIf that’s right, then I don’t think your proposed training method is sufficient to solve the problem I’m\npicking at.

Why don't you try explaining what you think you know\nto me and we'll see if I think you know something.\n\nJDP: Sure. So let's start with the problem.\n\nThe kinds of AI agents we want to build to solve hard problems require long horizon\nplanning algorithms pointed at a goal like \"maximize probability of observing a future\nworldstate in which the problem is solved\". Or argmax(p(problem_solved)) as it's usually\nnotated. The problem with pointing a superintelligent planner at argmax(p(problem_solved))\nexplicitly or implicitly (and most training setups implicitly do so) for almost\nany problem is that one of the following things is liable to happen:\n\n1. Your representation of the problem is imperfect, so if you point a\nsuperintelligent planner at it you get causal overfitting where the model\nidentifies incidental features of the problem [like that a human presses a button\nto label the answer](https://arbital.greaterwrong.com/p/pointing_finger?l=2s0)\nas the crux of the problem because these are the easiest parts of the causal chain\nfor an outcome label that it can influence.\n\n2. Your planner engages in instrumental reasoning like \"in order to continue solving\nthe problem I must remain on\" and prevents you from turning it off. This is a fairly\nobvious kind of thing for a planner to infer for the same reason if you gave an\nexisting LLM with memory issues a planner (e.g. monte carlo tree search over ReAct\nblocks) it would infer things like \"I must place this information here so when it\nleaves the context window and I need it later I will find it in the first place I look\".\n\nSo your options are to either use something other than `argmax()` to solve the\nproblem [(which has natural performance and VNM rationality coherence issues)](https://arbital.greaterwrong.com/p/otherizer?l=2r9) or\nget a sufficiently good representation ([ideally with confidence guarantees](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9fL22eBJMtyCLvL7j/soft-optimization-makes-the-value-target-bigger))\nof a sufficiently broad problem (e.g. utopia) that throwing your superintelligent\nplanner at it with instrumental reasoning is fine.\n\nYudkowsky:  These are real issues, yes.\n\nJDP: Would you say I've demonstrated sufficient insight into the alignment problem or do I need\nto say more?\n\nYudkowsky:  You’re still in the “identifying the difficult parts” phase.  Which,\nto be clear, is a genuine and necessary phase of work.  But the next phase is\n“explain how you actually plan to build a system that doesn’t do that, in enough\ndetail that I can see where it gets the relevant safety property and why that\ndoesn’t break the capabilities”.\n\nJDP: Alright let's do that then. Let's start by saying we have a traditional RL\nagent setup with a policy and a planner. Our policy is some foundation sequence\nprediction model in the vein of an LLM, our planner is monte carlo tree search over\nsomething like ReAct blocks or summaries of ReAct blocks. We prompt our policy\nfor continuations of a sequence of summarized ReAct blocks to get trajectories over\n(observation, reasoning, action, outcome) tuples. Subtrees are scored by asking the policy\nfor a yes/no label on questions like whether we're getting closer to our intended subgoal \nand whether the action we just took succeeded. In general we can break the yes/no questions\nfor a subgoal into \"Are we moving towards the subgoal?\" and \"Has the subgoal been accomplished?\"\nsince you need a smooth gradient of reward leading to the completion of the subgoal not \njust sparse discrete rewards for completion.\n\nYudkowsky: How do you ground these operations? Next token prediction is grounded simply\nenough because it's a pretraining objective with a well defined discrete program that checks\nwhether the neural net is succeeding or not. The more probability the network assigned to the\ncorrect next token (empirically observed and checkable through string equality) the better it did.\nBut what is a \"summary\", what is a \"question\"? If you're just getting these primitives by imitating\nhumans then it's not clear that they'll still mean the same things as the model undergoes distribution\nshift, which could undermine the entire design even before you've told me what alignment interventions\nyou're supposed to make to get safety properties.\n\nJDP: Great question. Yeah so we can think of it as kind of a chain of objectives that become \nincreasingly abstract.\n\nThe first objective is predicting the next token, which lets us define the backtranslation summary \nRL objective of finding a summary that makes the tokens of an original backtranslated text more likely. \nSo we start with a text and try to find s -> t such that summary s makes the tokens of t most likely in \nthe next token prediction objective. This works for the same reason why the information bottleneck \nprinciple in an autoencoder works: We're asking the network to find us a string which packs the most\nbits of the larger text we're trying to summarize (as measured by how much they empirically let us predict it) \ninto a smaller string length, which is basically what we want a summary to do. A summary should let us\nget the most information about the original document without having to read it. We can enforce that summaries\nstay readable by adding a KL penalty so they don't drift too far from the representation of normal strings\nin the models latent space. Since it learns what strings are normal from empirical observation of the external \nenvironment it should stay e.g. valid English or other signs and representations that agents use to communicate.\n\nThen with the backtranslation summary objective we can define a question in a rigorous way by saying that a \nquestion is the boolean result of a motor program appended to a summary such that the summary and the boolean \nanswer minimize the entropy of the motor program which produced the boolean answer label. So, given a boolean \nanswer we can find the question which matches the program-answer combo. Basically imagine we have:\n\n#Q: Was the thing changed in the environment? Yes.\ndef motor_program(environment):\n  environment.do_thing()\n  return environment.thing.changed\n\nA question is a *summary* appended with the *result* of the motor program. We can then ask\nafter running the program and getting its result whether the summary and the resulting outcome\nlabel does well at predicting the program we ran. So if we have a need for information like \"Did\nthis thing I just did successfully cause the desired outcome to happen?\" we want to ask questions\nwhich best predict (i.e. cause to be written in a sequence prediction model) the motor programs that\naccomplish our goals. If a motor program does not accomplish our goal the fixed outcome label is no\nand we want a question which when answered no predicts the failed program. If the outcome is yes\nwe want a question that predicts a motor program that would return yes. If we imagine starting with\ngibberish questions and grounded outcome labels from discrete motor programs then over time the\nnetwork would learn to use summaries which predict the outcome label after the question token `?`\nwhen it captions an action. A question is a summary biased in the direction of predicting the outcome\nof an executable program.\n\nThen having defined questions and trained a neural network on them we can interpolate between the \ndiscrete questions to estimate the answers to questions which can't be easily represented using discrete \nmotor programs. We can then define planning and reasoning as writing tokens which help us\nestimate the value of getting yes after a series of questions and answers. These can then be reinforced \nbased on how well they let us predict discrete 'terminal' outcomes which are verifiable using motor programs. \nThis in fact makes sense because the questions which are hard to define as the outcome of discrete programs \nare exactly the kind that we usually estimate by imagining a series of more abstract steps or questions that ground\nout into observable outcomes corresponding to discrete points in the continuous latent space of questions.\n\nIs that enough to convince you these operations are grounded?\n\nYudkowsky: It's enough to convince me that there is a plausible pathway to those operations being\ngrounded, obviously you don't actually know if it works in practice until you try it. If I wanted to be\npedantic I could say that the generalization behavior which works the way you want with pre-ASI\nusing those objectives might not work the same way with superintelligence but this is already much\nmore specific than the usual things I hear and I'm curious where you're going with this so please \ncontinue.\n\nJDP: Well so once you've defined these things you have the start of an answer to the ontology \nidentification problem. If we imagine a diamond maximizer (which notably we can build now in a\ngame like Minetest) with an architecture along these lines, we can prompt it with something like\n\"Develop and implement a strategy such that the largest part of the reachable universe possible\nis arranged into diamonds. Use the chemical definition of a diamond.\" and imagine it doing a chain\nof thought where it reminds itself what a diamond is made of, can think about whether we mean natural\nor synthetic diamonds (I mean synthetic), perhaps ask follow up questions, etc. Then when it's\nimplementing the plan it might run into diamond-like things which do not follow the chemical definition\nof a diamond. It can exclude these from fitness for diamond maximizing by executing and observing the\nresults of physical tests for diamond-nature. This is similar in spirit to how humans have dedicated hardware\n(tongue, nose, stomach, etc) for testing whether they have found nutrients to sustain their body or not. Notably \nthis also provides a roadmap for resolving the ontological crisis, in that even if we change ontologies the \nphysical tests for diamond nature exist independently of our ontology for describing their results. We can say \nthat a diamond is whatever satisfies the \"diamond contract\" in our previous ontology as laid out by the purity \ntests we use for diamondhood. Most actual human terminal reward signals like staying warm are actually more \nrobust than this in that they're not arbitrary goals but serve a functional survival purpose. So we can decompose \nvarious reward signals into their implied teleological purposes and ask if the thing our ontology is being upset by \nfulfills the same purposes and if it does then it's presumably a suitable substitute. If the agent creates its own \nsubgoals and grounds them in discrete motor programs to check for subgoal completion then you have a thing\nwhich reifies the diamond terminal goal with its thoughts and activities. It can be constantly asking \"does this\nget me closer to diamonds?\" and thereby act more like the hypothetical genetic fitness maximizing creatures\nin IABIED's chapter 4 parable that Trapaucius expects humans to evolve into. One advantage that we have\nover evolution is cheap access to a pretrained latent space to specify our goals in. I suspect that evolution\nexploits something like representation convergence to specify some goals in a pretrained latent space that\nwill eventually exist but this is presumably an expensive operation with worse feedback loops compared to\nwhat we can do with foundation models.\n\nYudkowsky:  That's an excellent place to bring up a problem, which is essentially: how do you\nknow that all of your complicated machinery preserves *what the humans meant* by a\ndiamond?\n\nA very simple failure mode is that the questions that your system learned to ask, in\norder to predict the motor program correctly, are only related to the things humans\nwere hoping to measure in very brittle ways.  Maybe it's actually answering\nquestions like “is the carbon a lattice, and is it at least 70% carbon atoms?” and\ntherefore goes off happily maximizing tiny specks of diamond dust on the ground and\nbeing happy even though nobody wanted that.  Or maybe the summary is only supposed\nto answer that sort of question in the presence of all the implicit context of what\nthe human experimenter was *imagining* as the background for such a question, and\nonce you get to superintelligence on a supercomputer running millions of experiments\nper second this breaks completely.  None of these feel like crushing objections to\nme, but they show how much work there is yet to do on turning words like \"chemical \ndefinition\" into what the system actually ends up checking.\n\nOne general thing that is hard about all alignment schemes is that you have to have\nsome story about why the AI is not optimizing for a proxy measure instead of the\nthing you meant. Part of the problem is that in many cases a proxy measure *is*\nwhat you wanted, you wanted to maximize some physical quantity like \"number of\ndiamonds\" and your story has to explain why maximizing the proxy actually leads to\nwhat you wanted instead of leading away from what you wanted due to Goodharting\neffects.\n\nJDP: The pedantic answer would be that diamonds were specifically chosen to be easy\nto represent with a low k-complexity. But obviously that doesn't generalize, let alone\ngeneralize to something as complex as human values so the answer about the \narchitecture is that the agent generates many novel questions in-context during its\nactivities. I hypothesize that much like how training on next token prediction gets\nyou a thing which largely understands the contours of the conceptual objects described\nby the tokens even if individual features of those objects have never been stated as such,\ntraining on many question and answer pairs about some property or goal in context should\nget you a system which understands the ineffable conceptual essence of the concept that we're\ntrying to convey underneath. Every one of the physical tests or predictions of future sensory\ninput is a contributor to understanding the platonic centroid of the diamond cluster in thingspace.\n\nAs a general principle a lot of my alignment strategy is to try and take the instrumental invariants\nwe assume like the Omohundro drives and flip them around so they work for us instead of against\nus. For example if the agent is defining the subgoals and we assume increasing rationality then \npresumably at a low level the agent will learn to avoid wireheading and subverting its own ability\nto check for subgoal completion because that will inhibit its ability to complete tasks. You then want\nit to use that anti-Goodharting instinct it learns in verifiable contexts to avoid wireheading and pursuing\nfake utility outside of the verifiable domain(s). Notably avoiding fake utility is listed by Omohundro\nas an instrumental invariant we should expect from a rational agent as it converges to coherence,\nso if we can get that invariant inside a search process which uses a prior that already has a good\nrepresentation of the thing we want in it then that lets us expect an increasing tendency towards\nadherence to our intended goal.\n\nYudkowsky: \nIt is an interesting hypothesis that the system learns to avoid Goodharting in\ngeneral, because of the lessons it learns in the domain where the checks work.\nThe difficulty is that the system you’re describing is not *in fact* a system\nthat is guaranteed to be coherent across reflective modification, or to keep the\nsame goals across learning on new data, or to keep the same goals in\nunobserved domains.  You can put it in a game like Minetest or in a simulated\nlaboratory and it will maybe do the thing you said, and then you pop it into\nthe real world and it has to make do with all kinds of implicit assumptions\nbaked into its training distribution that are no longer true outside.  Maybe\nthe real-world version of the diamond-test, where the computer gets its result\nby actually having physicists run mass-spectrometry on a diamond, returns “yes”\nwhen the diamond has been contaminated by nitrogen, because of course real\ntests in the real world sometimes go wrong. And now the system has learned to\nexpect from its own observations as it grew up that contaminated diamonds\nsometimes test as pure even though they are not.  It learned this while at the\nsame time never violating its own coherence criterion.  Which is to say that it\nhas learned to violate the representation you were hoping to set up. A single\nmisleading data point in training - perhaps from being given the wrong *kind*\nof test in the environment - and you’ve trained in a vulnerability that can be\nexploited to make the real-world model act wrong.\n\nYour optimistic hypothesis about the system learning to avoid Goodharting only \nworks to the extent the system sees through all of the proxy measures it’s being\ngiven— but that is exactly what your system is being trained to *fail* at.  If it\nperfectly rejected all proxies it would quickly stop hitting any reward button in\nits environment, because the reward button is itself a proxy, and that’s not the\nkind of thinking that actually gets updated upwards by gradient descent on the\nrewards you’re giving the system.\n\nJDP:\nOkay but wrong data points do occur during neural net training and they generally\ndon't actually poison the model into being wrong if the corpus is mostly right. Part \nof how you prevent causal overfitting is of course good old regularization strategies \nlike dropout. You do not actually want a learning system which is \"superintelligent\" \nby dint of making the strongest possible generalization from the details of datapoints\nsuch that it's making strong inferences based on noise. Such a system might not even\nbe functional in practice, it would be more like a schizophrenic or severely autistic person\nthan it is like Sherlock Holmes. But also I worry you might be missing the point on the\nin-context questions and discrete tests of properties of the environment. We have the model\nautonomously create these in-context all the time, so that it is pursuing many lossy proxies\nof the underlying goal which it already has some reasonable sense of. If you ask a language\nmodel to break a concept into parts it can generally speaking do so, and breaking concepts\ninto parts is not a hard capability to ground in that obviously the parts of a thing will appear\nas part of descriptions of the thing and you can empirically check if those occur in relation\nto the thing in your training corpus. So if you break an expectation into parts then you can\npick some subset of the parts to try and test or get more information about the problem state\nand if you do enough of that then it won't really matter that occasionally you have a test contaminated\nby nitrogen or whatever. Your policy gets moved a little in the direction of error by gradient\ndescent, and then move farther away in the direction of correctness by the updates which\nare actually directionally correct.\n\nYudkowsky:  I think you’ve implicitly pivoted the conversation to “what happens\nwhen the model is smart enough but not reflective-modify-on-new-data smart?”, i.e.\nyou are now describing something that is *not* the scary part of the alignment\nproblem.  The problem is not “what happens when the model mis-generalizes while\nit is learning from mostly-correct examples,” the problem is “what happens after\nit is already roughly-aligned and then it modifies itself in a way that moves off\nthe rails”?\n\nYour examples describe something that looks like a *post*-training generalization\nerror, rather than a *mid*-training error.  When I claim that the system will\n“learn to violate the representation you were hoping to set up,” I’m imagining\nthat it *already* has the diamond thing correct, but it finds a *new* way to turn\nthe universe into test-passing diamond-dust.\n\nIt’s already a superintelligent diamond maximizer, it already knows exactly what\nthe real deal is supposed to be -- it’s not being fooled by tests that\noccasionally give the wrong answer – but it figured out that the tests it was\ngiven were *proxy* tests, even though they were high-quality proxies, and after\nit finishes getting smarter it can now get what it *really* wants much more\nefficiently by just directly optimizing how to pass only those proxy tests instead\nof trying to produce actual diamonds.  Now it is off-target, and this is entirely\nits own choice.  Not the rest of the universe throwing corrupted data at it.\n\nJDP: Okay but the entire point is that the AI is the one coming up with the proxies\nin-context *using its full general intelligence* based on a prior that coming up with\nhonest tests is a good thing to do from early training environments with verifiable\nrewards which incentivize coming up with and finding ways to pass honest tests!\nAs the AI gets smarter the proxies get smarter, the proxies are also diverse and their\nerrors cancel out to get a thing which is actually interested in actual diamonds. Or at\nleast that's the hope. The entire goal of this setup is to have an AI which adaptively \ncreates diverse honest proxies for itself in such a way that it rewards itself for honestly\nsolving problems and punishes itself for dishonestly solving problems and in this way\nthrough Ghandi stability stays focused on the original goal in a self-reifying way. When\nit finds a clever hack that subverts the goal of the exercise it does not reward itself, it goes\n\"oh but that's a hack, the actual purpose here is to X\" in much the way that a human does.\n\nYudkowsky: What actually incentivizes the model to have the tests consist of any useful\nsemantic content once it's outside the verifiable domain? If I understand what you're saying\ncorrectly, the proposal is to have a thing that runs a program, which it designs, in order to satisfy\na property it chooses and then rewards itself based on whether the test passes or not. Why\nwould the RL process teach this agent to do anything other than always give itself a pass? You\nsay that you start with a verifiable domain, okay great, it makes sense that while the agent is\nin the distribution of the verifiable domain that it uses the tests to make sure it is succeeding\nat its actions. But once it's outside that domain what's to stop it from drifting and drifting towards\nwireheading as a solution? What's to stop it from selecting questions which are trivially \"yes\" but\naren't at all related? At some point, because the AI always \"succeeds\", the process is just giving \nits own internal goal representation maximal score; but the connection between the test and the\nexternal goal has been completely severed. \n\nJDP: Now we're starting to get into the parts I'm still a little fuzzy on. One thought I had was to\nhave tiers of reward with small chronic rewards the model controls in the moment and larger sparse\nrewards that the model sets up in advance before starting a task, basically committing to a certain\nkind of outcome. In general it seems important to me that you should scale rewards in proportion to\nhow verifiable and easy to Goodhart they are. You could add some kind of active learning scheme where\nif the agent is succeeding too often it's pushed to try harder things (how?). I have to imagine that wireheading\nwould be a low entropy activity in some sense so if you could detect that it might be a point of intervention. \nMaybe there's a way to tie the questions into some kind of unambiguous prediction objective somehow? \nIn much the same way that we  tied the summary objective into the next token prediction objective. I'm\nopen to ideas here tbh. I have the strong sense that there's something here you can do which clearly\nprevents wireheading from first principles I'm just struggling to think of it.\n\nYudkowsky: Let me think... you could try to get the model to notice that its plans are boring,\nit’s too easy to predict yes for itself, therefore its plans are in some sense insufficiently\n“surprising\" and are missing something important, so it should start doing things that are\nharder for itself to predict will succeed it wants more confirmation. A similar thing that\nhappens in humans when they start getting concerned about wireheading, that it all seems\ntoo “easy” in some sense that they struggle to verbalize but that in many cases they can\nnotice and point at?\n\nIdea: give the system an entropy-based reward that’s proportional to the surprisal of its\nown high-level summaries of its plans working, or the plan “passing” some test or making\na summary that ends in “success”?  Not surprisal of the outcome itself, i.e. the network\nisn’t *itself* surprised by its success, but that the expected *entropy* of the network’s\nsummaries of success has to stay high. There has to be a certain cognitive *dissonance*\nabout its own success; something about the plan has to be *uncertain* the first time the\nnetwork reads through it, even if the network is capable of verifying that it will work\nafter more cognition is brought to bear. If the network can fully predict its own success,\nit feels \"too easy,\" it’s cheating, and then it should do something more challenging.\nThis is a very hand-wavey way of phrasing it, but I suspect it might be a way of getting\nat the property that you want without relying on a property of the world that the system\ncan eventually hack.\n\nJDP: OK that's genuinely exciting to me. Like really exciting. The summary success\nentropy idea in combination with the rest of what I've been saying feels like it could\nreally solidly eliminate the wireheading failure mode. Actually implementing it of course\nwould be nontrivial and we’d have to figure out how to get entropy of success into the\ncost function in a meaningful way, but I’m glad we’re finally getting somewhere. The\nintuition that this solves core wireheading really feels solid. Let me think for a minute\nabout the entropy idea.\n\nI wonder if you could formalize this by training the model on sequences where the\nsuccess rate on the tasks selected goes up over time and when the model has gone too\nlong without encountering some \"surprising success\" it samples low-entropy","depth":15,"netCharsAdded":2333,"netWordsAdded":400,"characterCount":26507,"wordCount":4438,"recentlyAdded":false,"treeStats":{"maxChildDepth":0,"totalChildNodes":0,"lastChildUpdate":1758537530583,"maxWordCountOfChildren":4438,"maxCharCountOfChildren":26507,"unreadChildNodes":0,"ratedUpNodes":0,"ratedDownNodes":0,"recentNodes":0}}}
