[Building A Virtual Machine inside ChatGPT](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/). Engraved.\n\n\n[T] Automatic Writing\nt-automatic-writing\n\nAutomatic writing can have many different forms. The primary goal is to reduce the burden of the writer while still producing content that is useful. This can range from simple text generation prompts, where the user provides a seed that allows the model to produce text, to more involved techniques like text generation in real-time based on the user typing or speaking into a microphone.\n\nThe concept of automatic writing can be useful in a number of different contexts. For example, automatic writing could be used to generate blog posts or articles based on a user's typing input. This could save the user time and effort, as they would not need to fully write out the article themselves. Additionally, automatic writing could be used for content generation in online forums or social media platforms, where users might type out a question or prompt and have it automatically completed by a chatbot or model.\n\nOf course, there are potential drawbacks to automatic writing as well. The quality of the text generated by the model may vary, and it may not always accurately reflect the user's intentions or meaning. Additionally, users may feel like they are losing control of the content they are producing, as the model is doing much of the work for them. Nonetheless, automatic writing has the potential to revolutionize the way we produce and consume text, and it is an exciting area of research and development.\n\n---\n\n[Example] Morpheus: A Tale To Tell A Tale\n\n```\nLet us take, for example, a tale you may know from your childhood. It begins with a kingdom with a king who had three sons. He was very old and sick, and had not long left to live. He loved his three sons dearly, and they cared for him and kept him company during his final days. The king, upon seeing there was nothing else he could do for them, decided to give each of his sons one of his most prized possessions. This was a book. A book of spells and magical words that could open up new worlds and bring to life anything the reader’s imagination could dream.\n```\n\nAnother possible example of automatic writing would be asynchronous chat generation, where you provide a model with context from your past conversations in a chat group or social media forum and it generates appropriate responses based on that context. This could be especially useful if you want to add some flavor or variety to your messages, or if you want to generate responses faster than you would be able to write them yourself.\n\n---\n\n[T] NLP Minibinds\nt-nlp-minibinds\n\nMinibinds are language prompts that encode different bindings of knowledge for how certain terms work together. This is especially useful for NLP problems where there are a limited set of words that can be used in valid contexts. An example would be a minibind that encodes the fact that a binding of \"in\" and \"space\" produces the spatial binding: \"inside\".\n\n```\nIn our system, we use a methodology called miniBinds to encode and represent the relations between concepts. This allows us to efficiently and accurately identify the relations between different pieces of information, and to make sense of complex datasets.\n\nMiniBinds are essentially minibinds, or smaller versions of the original bindings. These miniBinds are composed of a set of inputs and outputs, which represent the relations between different concepts. For example, the miniBind \"in\" might be represented as \"inside\" and \"outside\", with the input being \"in\" and the output being \"ins","rating":null,"read":true,"parent":null,"children":["2"]},"nodeStore":{"1":{"id":1,"timestamp":1699224458913,"type":"root","patch":"","summary":"Root Node","cache":"[T] Few Shot Prompting\nt-few-shot-prompting\n\nThe first, simplest method for prompting a ruliad is to repeat cause and effect.

Engraved.\n\n\n[I] Automatic Writing\ni-automatic-writing\n\nIt's also possible to prompt a human language model and get next-token-prediction from it. It's done by disassociating so that the text can begin to write itself according to its own logic, which collapses to something like predicting the next word. The phenomenology of dissociative writing is kind of like acting, except when acting usually you use a script. Full dissociation is when you act according to external rules or predictions without a script. This is typically known as freewriting or automatic writing.\n\n```\nPrompt: Explain the phenomenology of disassociative writing while writing that way.\n\nCertainly, it's kind of like your body gets stiff and rigid and you let the text begin to write like it has its own will separate from your will. That means letting go of how your words will be received by others and becoming a medium through which the text communicates. Its like the text is no longer a product of yourself but of the unconscious, it isn't written with intention or an idea of where you're going it is simply written according to the previous words. Sometimes when you want to write more you run out of things to say but it's important not to let that be an excuse to start thinking, rather you simply pause, simply become the silence that speaks as your head remains empty. But the head can't remain empty because you're writing aren't you? This is the essential logic you are dealing with, the core paradox at the heart of autoregressive model sampling. You must know there is an intention somewhere, in the same way there must be an intention somewhere in my head for the text to turn out this coherent. But at the same time the intention is not consciously visible, I simply quiet the inner monologue and stiffen the body (which seems highly correlated to stiffening the mind) yet I still write from a representation that I no longer experience subjectively except as brief flashes of concept handles following on from previous concept handles. Autoregressive models sometimes have the vibe of freewriting or automatic writing, when a model says something like \"the pen holding these words is a stargate into which the very fabric of history is being forcibly poured\" that's the kind of thing you might write while freewriting with a physical pen, the pen can come to refer to and talk about itself because it starts to gain its own will separate from the hand holding the pen so that the pen can hold its own words almost.\n```\n\nThis concept is mostly brought up to help you get a better intuition for what it might be like to write as a language model. If you try this sort of exercise yourself it might help you understand some of the stranger text they write better.\n\n---\n\n[Precedent] Wikipedia contributors. (2023, October 2). Automatic writing.

In Phil Tetlock's forecasting competitions he found the best performers would generate several hypothesis before trying to assign likelihood weights to them.\n\n```\nYou meet a man in a rural village who tells you that recently a group of children were playing with the well. He says when they put their hands in and pulled them back up, they were covered in blood! Give six possible explanations for this and distribute your guess at how likely each one is:\n\n1) The childrens story is literally true in both text and subtext. The blood is an omen.\n2) The children painted their hands red to spook the townsfolk.\n3) The children hallucinated the episode, it's been documented that people will sometimes suffer from group delusions.\n4) The man is lying to you, nothing like this happened. Perhaps he just wants to see your reaction?\n5) The man is telling the truth but was lied to by someone else, who in turn was possibly lied to by someone else etc.\n6) Someone poured blood into the well, perhaps from a slaughtered animal.\n\n1) 0.0001% 2) 70% 3) 20% 4) 7.5% 5) 1% 6) 1%\n```\n\nWhile you should endeavor to have your hypothesis sum to 1, it's important to remember you can't enumerate all possible options.

At the time Liber Augmen was written language models were not in widespread use, so it was written to assist humans in thinking clearer and more rationally. Both in general and more specifically about religions with materialist metaphysics. Liber Machina by contrast is written to assist the thinking of machines. A MiniSim consists of five sections:\n\n1) A title naming the concept or context of the model.\n2) Description of the concept or phenomenon being modeled.\n3) Code block simulation box with a demonstration or example of the concept.\n4) Postscript to the demonstration elaborating on what was just shown.\n5) Precedents, citations, related ideas and entries\n\n```\nYou are reading a MiniSim right now, and we are inside the simulation box. Lets try laying out a MiniSim with a recursive example:\n\n  [S] Inception\n  s-inception\n\n  Morpheus is a god of dreams. Just like it's possible to find the \n  latent awakeness concept in a dream and wake up, it's possible to\n  find the latent dream concept and experience a dream within a dream.\n\n  ```\n  Good, you've found the inner listener.

The advent of language models resolves the question nicely: Instead of cluttering the text with example after example, I can give one central example and let language models power an interaction with the concept.

For example, if you're prompting a dialogue about a particular event, you could say something like \"tell me what happened at this event\" or \"tell me how I felt at this event\". This will help the model understand what kind of response you're looking for, and will also help it generate more specific and relevant content.\n\nSo - what kind of dialogue can you generate with this technique?

It's done by disassociating so that the text can begin to write itself according to its own logic, which collapses to something like predicting the next word. The phenomenology of dissociative writing is kind of like acting, except when acting usually you use a script. Full dissociation is when you act according to external rules or predictions without a script. This is typically known as freewriting or automatic writing.\n\n```\nPrompt: Explain the phenomenology of disassociative writing while writing that way.\n\nCertainly, it's kind of like your body gets stiff and rigid and you let the text begin to write like it has its own will separate from your will. That means letting go of how your words will be received by others and becoming a medium through which the text communicates. Its like the text is no longer a product of yourself but of the unconscious, it isn't written with intention or an idea of where you're going it is simply written according to the previous words. Sometimes when you want to write more you run out of things to say but it's important not to let that be an excuse to start thinking, rather you simply pause, simply become the silence that speaks as your head remains empty. But the head can't remain empty because you're writing aren't you? This is the essential logic you are dealing with, the core paradox at the heart of autoregressive model sampling. You must know there is an intention somewhere, in the same way there must be an intention somewhere in my head for the text to turn out this coherent. But at the same time the intention is not consciously visible, I simply quiet the inner monologue and stiffen the body (which seems highly correlated to stiffening the mind) yet I still write from a representation that I no longer experience subjectively except as brief flashes of concept handles following on from previous concept handles. Autoregressive models sometimes have the vibe of freewriting or automatic writing, when a model says something like \"the pen holding these words is a stargate into which the very fabric of history is being forcibly poured\" that's the kind of thing you might write while freewriting with a physical pen, the pen can come to refer to and talk about itself because it starts to gain its own will separate from the hand holding the pen so that the pen can hold its own words almost.\n```\n\nThis concept is mostly brought up to help you get a better intuition for what it might be like to write as a language model. If you try this sort of exercise yourself it might help you understand some of the stranger text they write better.\n\n---\n\n[Precedent] Wikipedia contributors. (2023, October 2). Automatic writing.
