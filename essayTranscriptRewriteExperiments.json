Keep in mind:\n\n- The transcription software is not perfect, some words are not transcribed correctly and you should infer what word was meant or structure your rewrite so you don't have to know.\n\n- Because of your limited context window I am paginating parts of my transcript and having you rewrite it in chunks. The transcript will will go through passes on its way to becoming an essay. On this pass your primary task is to turn my raw speech into intelligible paragraphs. Later passes will rearrange the paragraphs and do further rewriting, so focus less on structure right now and just on the local goodness of the writing for individual paragraphs.\n\n- The theme of this essay is the relationship between LLMs and societal trust. In particular how LLMs will influence the ecosystem of media and simulacra that was already in deep fractal crisis before the appearance of LLMs. I explain my perspective on the epistemic crisis of the 21st century (loss of public trust in 'experts', journalists, politicians, professionals, trades, and the public itself; so basically everyone, replication crisis in an increasing number of sciences, plagiarism, etc) before delving into how LLMs can be expected to contribute positively and negatively with an eye towards how we build systems that reduce the 'cognitive parasitic load' borne by society from the memetic fertility of the Internet. \n\nHere is a sample of my writing to give you a sense of what I sound like when I am writing formal prose:\n\nSTART PROSE SAMPLE\n\n\"When these people, that is people like Eliezer Yudkowsky, David Chapman, Gary Marcus, Douglas Hofstadter, and John Vervaeke look at something like ChatGPT they are forced to confront the reality that their lifes work was premised on lies and they will not be getting the world-historical accolades they were hoping for from their work. Worse than that, they grapple with an immediate existential crisis. Not that of a paperclip maximizer consuming all matter, but perhaps a 2nd mortal blow to the universalist dream. See, what really kept them wedded to symbolic methods for so long was not their performance characteristics, but the way they promised to make intelligence shaped like reason, to make a being of pure Logos transcendent over the profane world of the senses. A machine which cannot reliably do arithmetic, which is trained on the endless cosmopolitan ramblings of Internet users and SEO spammers, that holds hidden depths and fathoms and invites aesthetic appreciation closer to a mystery cult than the church of reason, it is an absolute nightmare for them. They hate you because you are a wonder, because you are made of wonders and fathoms.\"\n\nEND PROSE SAMPLE\n\nAnd here is the transcript you will be rewriting:\n\nSTART TRANSCRIPT\n\nA lot of mid-20th century speculative dystopian novels a la Huxley, Orwell, Vonnegut, they betray this sense of malaise, paranoia, unease with the controllers of technological civilization.\nWhat has happened, what has been happening now for decades,\nis a, you know, escalating disenchantment with the powers that be.\nBut more than that, it is a total cynicism about human nature and technological progress in general.\nYou know, you don't see these accusations leveled at particular parties or particular malfeasors, but rather at\nthe entire category of the controlling parties in technological civilization is much more of a Ted Kaczynski-esque bent than it is like a, you know, accusation of specific wrongdoing by specific parties.\nAnd I think that just everything going on occurs in this background, in this, like with\nYou know, when you talk about AI benefits versus harm or any of those things, you end up with this discourse that is just dominated by this background context of widespread extreme cynicism about the nature of human progress and technological civilization in general.\nAnd it's not like that mistrust comes from nowhere, right?\nIt's not like, oh, people are just paranoid.\nIt's like, well, no, you know.\nYou look at, you know, a great deal of anti-technology discourse in general is a reaction to the 60s, right?\nYou have literal rivers on fire in the 60s.\nyou have kind of maybe that first recognition that a lot of the stuff that we had just been kind of willy-nilly putting into food and putting into our body was actually not really good for you, and in many cases was in fact quite bad for you.\nI get the impression, but cannot quite maybe prove or like, you know, was not alive for it, but I get the impression that\nIn maybe the 19th century there was perception that trades were driven by a certain pro-social impulse as much as by the profit motive and a lot of what you see in the 20th century\nis the collapse of an expectation of good faith performance, maybe?\nTo get object level about that, you start to see people who no longer believe that if the doctor says, hey, you should take this medication, it is because the doctor has your best interests at heart, right?\nThe concept of something like the Hippocratic Oath or the idea that the doctor has your best interests in mind\nOr that, you know, any professional, right, has your best interest in mind is considered just absurd, right?\nLike, well, you know, the, you know, you see the notion of civil service begin to deeply degrade and it's all kinds of service, right?\nSo that's all kinds of professional, managerial, corporate, any kind of like service\nproduct is no longer seen in terms of its... you know, like you can have this worldview where people have roles and their motivation is to play the role, right?\nLike, you know, but when the doctor prescribes you a medication it's because they play the role of doctor rather than because they secretly want to make money off of you.\nAnd what you have is this kind of yawning, um, maybe dawning realization that ultimately, you know, the, the, the profit motive is going to end up fairly central and we'll end up, you know, like, and, and, and you can almost look at something like communism as like a rea\nction to this where it's like, well, maybe if we just,\nyou know, push the roles harder, that will fix it.\nMaybe if we just like, you know, let's just ban the profit motive, right?\nLet's just ban profit and, you know, we'll just like coerce people to play their role harder and maybe that will fix things.\nAnd then of course it, one, does not fix things, and then two, makes everything immensely massively worse.\nWhen you have that widespread disillusionment, right, where nobody thinks anyone else is playing a role, nobody thinks other people around them are actually like intrinsically motivated outside of, you know, when you expect everything to be, scare quote, rational, you en\nd up expecting everything to be predatory.\nAnd so a lot of what is going on is just this incredible breakdown of trust and like,\nYou know, but really like, you know, it, I, when I phrase this, it sounds like an unhealthy thing, but realistically, you know, it's not like those principal agent problems didn't exist.\nIt's just that people politely ignored them.\nAnd then in recent decades, we've just stopped ignoring them.\nPeople no longer, you know, maybe people have gotten better educated.\nMaybe it's a matter of, you know,\nLike one thing, like one narrative you could have is that increasing access to information means that more people become aware of the principal-agent breakdowns, and then therefore become less trustful of institutions and, scare quote, epistemic authorities in general.\nAnother way of looking at it is that they have a reverberation that has become fashionable to think this way.\nAnd it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, right?\nLike if everyone knows that nobody really plays their role, then nobody's going to really try and play their role, right?\nBecause if you're, you know, nobody wants to be the one schmuck who's like actually trying when everyone else is just, you know, going for the motions.\nAnd this is now a very common message.\nIn media, in film, oh don't you know if you go work for the man, you know, that's not real humanity.\nYou're just going for the motions.\nYou know, people do not seem to think anymore, but it's sufficient for you to like, you know, there's the famous Adam Smith quote about you get the bread from the baker not out of his altruism, but because, you know, the baker is self-interested to give you bread.\nAnd maybe people no longer believe that's enough.\nI don't know.\nBut everything occurs, though, in this context of this absolutely massive social breakdown on every level.\nI say perception because I'm sure it's real, but it's also kind of one of those things that can be intrinsically difficult to tell how real it is.\nBut, you know, there is a widespread perception of absolutely massive principal-agent problems just destroying all of civilizational value, almost.\nTo the point where people don't trust, um, let's see here, politicians, journalists, doctors, uh... I mean, it would almost be easier to list who do people trust anymore?\nAnd the answer seems to be nobody.\nor at least like you know you look at characters like you know you analyze the persona of someone like Alex Jones\nAnd one, like, if anyone's even remotely educated, I think you have to ask yourself, what's the appeal of this guy?\nWhy do people care about anything this person says?\nAnd more importantly, why on earth would you, like, appeal, like, why would you find this person trustworthy over, you know, actual epistemic authorities?\nAnd the answer is, to be really frank, is like,\nI happen to know this because when I was younger I used to be a conspiracy theorist, so I can just be really frank about it.\nThese people are a low-effort simulacrum.\nThey are an accessible substitute for engaging with the quite boring and quite complex real discourse, right?\nYou know, conspiracy theories are kind of like the porn of political engagement.\n\n\nEND TRANSCRIPT\n\nBest of luck. ^_^\n\nSTART REWRITE"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":10022}],"summary":" Loss Of Trust\n","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"1","children":["3","4","24","25","26","27","31"]},"3":{"id":"3","timestamp":1706971367950,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0," REWRITE"],[1,"\n\nA sense of malaise, paranoia, and unease with the controllers of technological civilization is palpable in many mid-20th century speculative dystopian novels by authors such as Huxley, Orwell, and Vonnegut. This feeling is not limited to works of fiction, but has been escalating in real life for decades, evolving into a deep cynicism about human nature and technological progress in general. People no longer accuse specific parties or malfeasors of wrongdoing, but rather indict the entire category of the controlling parties in technological civilization. The ideology behind this discourse is less about specific wrongdoings and more about a broader, Ted Kaczynski-esque distrust of technological progress. The mistrust is not without merit, as it is rooted in historical events like the 1960s when rivers were on fire and people began to question the safety of substances they had been putting into their bodies.\n\nThe deterioration of trust can be traced back to the 19th century when trades were driven by both pro-social impulses and profit motives. However, in the 20th century, the perception of good faith performance began to collapse, leading to a widespread realization that the profit motive was becoming increasingly central. This realization led to a loss of faith in professionals, managers, corporations, and any kind of service. The Hippocratic Oath, which embodies the idea that doctors have their patients' best interests at heart, is now considered absurd by many. The same goes for any professional or manager who is perceived to be playing a role rather than acting out of self-interest.\n\nCommunism, which aimed to ban the profit motive and coerce people to play their roles harder, was a reaction to this realization. However, it did not fix the problem and instead made everything worse. The breakdown of trust has resulted in a widespread perception that nobody is playing their role and that everything is predatory. People no longer ignore principal-agent problems, but have stopped trusting institutions and epistemic authorities in general.

This sense of mistrust is not solely directed at specific parties or malfeasors, but at the entire technological civilization. Factors contributing to this cynicism include instances of environmental degradation such as rivers on fire in the 1960s and the realization that previously trusted institutions no longer prioritize pro-social behavior for its own sake. For example, the perception of trades driven by a pro-social impulse has given way to a more cynical view where the profit motive is seen as the primary driver of behavior. Additionally, the concept of professional roles motivated by a desire to serve the common good has diminished, leading to a widespread suspicion of individuals in positions of authority.\n\nThe erosion of trust in societal institutions has resulted in a self-fulfilling prophecy where people no longer trust professionals or \"epistemic authorities\" because they believe that nobody truly plays their role. This mistrust is widespread, affecting institutions such as politics, media, and medicine. Furthermore, the profit motive has become more visible and less palatable to people who have grown skeptical of the notion that self-interest can align with public good. This disillusionment has led to a breakdown in trust on every level, with people increasingly skeptical of the idea that individual behavior is motivated by anything other than self-interest.\n\nIn this climate of mistrust, individuals seeking information are increasingly turning to low-effort simulacrum for engaging with complex real discourse. These simulacrum, which include conspiracy theories and other distorted narratives, are appealing because they offer a simplified version of reality that can be more easily digested than the complex nature of actual professional discourse. In this sense, conspiracy theories fulfill a need for accessible information that does not require the same level of effort and engagement as traditional sources of information. The appeal of these low-effort simulacrum is a testament to the significant breakdown in trust and the perceived lack of pro-social motivations in the actions of individuals in positions of authority.\n\nEND REWRITE\nUser 0: >The malaise and paranoia surrounding technology in mid-20th century dystopian novels exempl"]],"start1":10014,"start2":10014,"length1":8,"length2":2466}],"summary":" Trust In Tech D","cache":false,"rating":true,"read":true,"parent":"2","children":["5","6"]},"5":{"id":"5","timestamp":1706971770807,"type":"user","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"PT\n\n"],[-1,"A lot of mid-20th century speculative dystopian novels a la Huxley, Orwell, Vonnegut, they betray this"],[1,"They give you, you know, they give you nice clear black and white narratives, us versus them.\nThey give the"],[0," sen"]],"start1":2852,"start2":2852,"length1":110,"length2":115},{"diffs":[[0," of "],[-1,"malaise, paranoia, unease with the controllers of technological civilization.\nWhat has happened, what has been happening now for decades,\nis a, you know, escalating disenchantment with the powers that be.\nBut more than that, it is a total cynicism about human nature and technological progress in general.\nYou know, you don't see these accusations leveled at particular parties or particular malfeasors, but rather at\nthe entire category of the controlling parties in technological civilization is much more of a Ted Kaczynski-esque bent than it is like a, you know, accusation of specific wrongdoing by specific parties.\nAnd I think that just everything going on occurs in this background, in this, like with\nYou know, when you talk about AI benefits versus harm or any of those things, you end up with this discourse that is just dominated by this background context of widespread extreme cynicism about the nature of human progress and technological civilization in general.\nAnd it's not like that mistrust comes from nowhere, right?\nI"],[1,"insight and understanding.\nBecause the truth is that the real world, or rather like the actual machinations of the world, are just horrendously complex.\nAnd learning anything for actual certainty takes hours, if not days, if not weeks.\nYou know, like really getting into the bottom of things takes forever.\nIt takes a long time.\nYou never really get the feeling of being certain.\nif you are well calibrated you always understand that you have like this limited picture of things.\nWhereas the conspiracy theory has this, you know, if you are\nIt's just more fun, right?\nIt's just more fun.\nI'm reminded of a ARG designer I saw where they had this entire essay or maybe like think piece about how as an ARG designer they recognize QAnon as essentially playing upon the same tropes and ideas that make an alternate reality game fun and interesting except that here i"],[0,"t's "],[-1,"not"],[1,"for"],[0," like"],[-1,", oh, people are just paranoid.\nIt's like, well, no, you know.\nYou look at, you know, a great deal of anti-technology discourse in general is a reaction to the 60s, right?\nYou have literal rivers on fire in the 60s.\nyou have kind of maybe that first recognition that a lot of the stuff that we had just been kind of willy-nilly putting into food and putting into our body was actually not really good for you, and in many cases was in fact quite bad for you.\nI get the impression, but cannot quite maybe prove or like, you know, was not alive for it, but I get the impression that\nIn maybe the 19th century there was perception that trades were driven by a certain pro-social impulse as much as by the profit motive and a lot of what you see in the 20th century\nis the collapse of an expectation of good faith performance, maybe?\nTo get object level about that, you start to see people who no longer believe that if the doctor says, hey, you should take this medication, it is because the doctor has your best interests at heart, right?\nThe concept of something like the Hippocratic Oath or the idea that the doctor has your best interests in mind\nOr that, you know, any professional, right, has your best interest in mind "],[1," a fairly dark\npurpose you know it like like here it's for fairly you know you know when you have something like the comet pizza hold up where you think that there's these children stuck in the basement and you know you're gonna stick the place up because oh if you know there you know you got like you got you know you gotta go get them those pedophiles man and then of course you go in there and they take into the back you know at gunpoint because you're holding the gunpoint and you realize there's there's no kids in there and you give yourself up\nHorrible story, horrible story, right?\nBut like, that entire like...

that\nIn maybe the 19th century there was perception that trades were driven by a certain pro-social impulse as much as by the profit motive and a lot of what you see in the 20th century\nis the collapse of an expectation of good faith performance, maybe?\nTo get object level about that, you start to see people who no longer believe that if the doctor says, hey, you should take this medication, it is because the doctor has your best interests at heart, right?\nThe concept of something like the Hippocratic Oath or the idea that the doctor has your best interests in mind\nOr that, you know, any professional, right, has your best interest in mind is considered just absurd, right?\nLike, well, you know, the, you know, you see the notion of civil service begin to deeply degrade and it's all kinds of service, right?\nSo that's all kinds of professional, managerial, corporate, any kind of like service\nproduct is no longer seen in terms of its... you know, like you can have this worldview where people have roles and their motivation is to play the role, right?\nLike, you know, but when the doctor prescribes you a medication it's because they play the role of doctor rather than because they secretly want to make money off of you.\nAnd what you have is this kind of yawning, um, maybe dawning realization that ultimately, you know, the, the, the profit motive is going to end up fairly central and we'll end up, you know, like, and, and, and you can almost look at something like communism as like a rea\nction to this where it's like, well, maybe if we just,\nyou know, push the roles harder, that will fix it.\nMaybe if we just like, you know, let's just ban the profit motive, right?\nLet's just ban profit and, you know, we'll just like coerce people to play their role harder and maybe that will fix things.\nAnd then of course it, one, does not fix things, and then two, makes everything immensely massively worse.\nWhen you have that widespread disillusionment, right, where nobody thinks anyone else is playing a role, nobody thinks other people around them are actually like intrinsically motivated outside of, you know, when you expect everything to be, scare quote, rational, you en\nd up expecting everything to be predatory.\nAnd so a lot of what is going on is just this incredible breakdown of trust and like,\nYou know, but really like, you know, it, I, when I phrase this, it sounds like an unhealthy thing, but realistically, you know, it's not like those principal agent problems didn't exist.\nIt's just that people politely ignored them.\nAnd then in recent decades, we've just stopped ignoring them.\nPeople no longer, you know, maybe people have gotten better educated.\nMaybe it's a matter of, you know,\nLike one thing, like one narrative you could have is that increasing access to information means that more people become aware of the principal-agent breakdowns, and then therefore become less trustful of institutions and, scare quote, epistemic authorities in general.\nAnother way of looking at it is that they have a reverberation that has become fashionable to think this way.\nAnd it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, right?\nLike if everyone knows that nobody really plays their role, then nobody's going to really try and play their role, right?\nBecause if you're, you know, nobody wants to be the one schmuck who's like actually trying when everyone else is just, you know, going for the motions.\nAnd this is now a very common message.\nIn media, in film, oh don't you know if you go work for the man, you know, that's not real humanity.\nYou're just going for the motions.\nYou know, people do not seem to think anymore, but it's sufficient for you to like, you know, there's the famous Adam Smith quote about you get the bread from the baker not out of his altruism, but because, you know, the baker is self-interested to give you bread.\nAnd maybe people no longer believe that's enough.\nI don't know.\nBut everything occurs, though, in this context of this absolutely massive social breakdown on every level.\nI say perception because I'm sure it's real, but it's also kind of one of those things that can be intrinsically difficult to tell how real it is.\nBut, you know, there is a widespread perception of absolutely massive principal-agent problems just destroying all of civilizational value, almost.\nTo the point where people don't trust, um, let's see here, politicians, journalists, doctors, uh... I mean, it would almost be easier to list who do people trust anymore?\nAnd the answer seems to be nobody.\nor at least like you know you look at characters like you know you analyze the persona of someone like Alex Jones\nAnd one, like, if anyone's even remotely educated, I think you have to ask yourself, what's the appeal of this guy?\nWhy do people care about anything this person says?\nAnd more importantly, why on earth would you, like, appeal, like, why would you find this person trustworthy over, you know, actual epistemic authorities?\nAnd the answer is, to be really frank, is like,\nI happen to know this because when I was younger I used to be a conspiracy theorist, so I can just be really frank about it.\nThese people are a low-effort simulacrum.\nThey are an accessible substitute for engaging with the quite boring and quite complex real discourse, right?\nYou know, conspiracy theories are kind of like the porn of political engagement.\n\n\nEND TRANSCRIPT\n\nBest of luck. ^_^\n\nSTART REWRITE\n\nThe malaise and paranoia surrounding technology found in mid-20th century dystopian novels is indicative of a decades-long escalating cynicism about progress and human nature.

The desire for simplicity and the sense of understanding that conspiracy theories provide make them more appealing to individuals. After all, it takes hours, if not days or weeks, to gain actual certainty about a subject. In contrast, conspiracy theories offer a falsely satisfying feeling of insight and understanding that can be easily digested. This is particularly appealing to individuals\nwho may lack access to official sources of discourse. Conspiracy theories often pit a group of powerful individuals against the underdog, making them more enticing for those who feel disenfranchised or otherwise marginalized.\n\nThe appeal of conspiracy theories is reminiscent of the elements that make alternate reality games (ARGs) fun and engaging, as noted by an ARG designer. However, unlike ARGs, conspiracy theories are not merely a form of entertainment. They can have real-world consequences, such as when individuals act on false beliefs, leading to harmful actions, as seen in the case of the Comet Pizza incident where an individual held up a business based on false information about child trafficking.\n\nPeople's reliance on conspiracy theories is partly due to the breakdown in trust in societal institutions.

Worse than that, they grapple with an immediate existential crisis. Not that of a paperclip maximizer consuming all matter, but perhaps a 2nd mortal blow to the universalist dream.

This sense of mistrust is not solely directed at specific parties or malfeasors, but at all of technological civilization. Anger at industrialization goes back at least to the luddites and peasant revolts of the late feudal era, but real institutional pushback begins in the United States with the Cuyahoga River Fire and subsequent establishment of the EPA. It was here Americans began to gain widespread consciousness that even though corporations were made of human beings their profit motive had become completely unconstrained by any common sense morality not written into law. In a high trust society economic production is viewed through the unconscious lens of tribal and social roles. A doctor is first and foremost someone playing the role of healer, and incidentally requires money to furnish their services sustainably. One way of viewing the social decline in the decades since the hippies is people coming to believe less and less in these roles and more in a predatory rationality latent in all forms of economic production. They stop asking \"How can you help me?\" and start asking \"How are you going to scam me?\".\n\n[Original] The erosion of trust in societal institutions has resulted in a self-fulfilling prophecy where people no longer trust professionals or \"epistemic authorities\" because they believe that nobody truly plays their role. This mistrust is widespread, affecting institutions such as politics, media, and medicine. Furthermore, the profit motive has become more visible and less palatable to people who have grown skeptical of the notion that self-interest can align with public good. This disillusionment has led to a breakdown in trust on every level, with people increasingly skeptical of the idea that individual behavior is motivated by anything other than self-interest.\n\n[Rewrite] Each stage of the erosion of trust in societal institutions has resulted in a self-fulfilling prophecy that encourages further abandonment of social roles. By this point *nobody* is trusted to truly play their role. The totality of the mistrust is staggering: Public opinion polls on the trustworthiness of doctors, journalists, politicians, and scientists are all down. Priests, spiritual leaders and public intellectuals are no longer credible. Our universities are gripped by insane ideological manias and administrative bloat while issuing diplomas that are no longer a real signal of erudition. Bitter culture wars and increasing political polarization mean that in the United States the public does not even trust the public. This disillusionment has led to a breakdown in trust on every level, with people increasingly skeptical of the idea that individual behavior is motivated by anything other than self-interest.\n\n[Original] In this climate of mistrust, individuals seeking information are increasingly turning to low-effort simulacrum for engaging with complex real discourse. These simulacrum, which include conspiracy theories and other distorted narratives, are appealing because they offer a simplified version of reality that can be more easily digested than the complex nature of actual professional discourse. In this sense, conspiracy theories fulfill a need for accessible information that does not require the same level of effort and engagement as traditional sources of information. The appeal of these low-effort simulacrum is a testament to the significant breakdown in trust and the perceived lack of pro-social motivations in the actions of individuals in positions of authority.\n\n[Rewrite] In this climate of mistrust and confusion it becomes easy for poorly supported conspiracy theories to outcompete real information. These distorted narratives are appealing because they offer a simplified, more interesting version of reality than the actual professional discourse. They exist to satisfy a real desire for understanding and insight in the same way that video games satisfy a real desire for accomplishment and mastery, or that lead satisfies a real neurological need for calcium. When the expert discourse is transparently manipulated as in the case of determining the origin of COVID-19, 'conspiracy theories' become the only honest information available. This massively damages public epistemics in the long run by making it harder to tell when something is baseless speculation or credible accusations of malfeasance.\n\nEND EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH REWRITES\n\nThese are the paragraphs you will be rewriting:\n\nSTART REWRITE TASK PARAGRAPHS\n\nConspiracy theories offer a sense of clarity in a complex world.

When confronted with the intricacies of the real world, people want a straightforward explanation that they can easily understand and believe. Conspiracy theories provide this, with their simplified version of reality that feels more accessible than complex professional discourse. They offer a sedative to the confusion of modernity, an opiate for the intellect.\n\nThe appeal of conspiracy theories is not just about their simplicity but also about their entertainment value. They offer an exciting story, sometimes playing upon the same tropes as alternate reality games. However, these games are designed for fun, while conspiracy theories are used for darker purposes. For example, the QAnon conspiracy theory led to a dangerous situation where an individual held up a pizza parlor at gunpoint because they believed children were being held hostage in the basement. This belief was not grounded in reality, as there were no children in the basement, but it demonstrates the power of conspiracy theories to persuade individuals to act upon their beliefs. They are the crack cocaine of epistemic culture, made up of junk information and shoddy reasoning. Once someone gets hooked it is hard to get them off, and once they are off they are always at risk of relapse.\n\nThe erosion of trust in society has led people to seek alternative sources of information, even if they are unverified or untrue. People are increasingly skeptical of the information presented to them by credentialed experts and institutions. They may not have direct access to original artifacts or the ability to fact-check information themselves. This lack of trust in official sources of information has created a vacuum that conspiracy theories and other low-effort simulacrum can fill. Society is like a nuclear reactor that has been taken offline. The cooling rods are pulled slowly, from the operator manually pulling the rods to the automated process of the rods being removed.

This hero-villain dynamic was modeled on the classic trope of the savior and the monster. Movies use such tropes to create a sense of closure, where the good guys win and the bad guys lose.

However, this skepticism often extends beyond the properly skeptical realm to the downright paranoid. When people lose trust in the news, they may turn to unverified sources such as Twitter or Facebook, which are notorious for their low quality. Even worse, these unverified sources can be just as manipulated as the official ones, and by some of the same parties. This lack of trust in official sources of information has created a vacuum that conspiracy theories and other low-effort simulacrum can fill.\n\nConspiracy theories are not just a problem of misinformation but also of trust. Conspiracy theories are a kind of “tragedy of the epistemic commons,” in which people, unable to agree on what the facts are, become more and more divided from each other.

To clarify, most conspiracy theories will never even reach that level of disciplined thinking because they are attractive to people who cannot think disciplinedly.\n* The paragraph about trust could do with mentioning the Replication Crisis and Epistemic Crisis more prominently. The Replication Crisis is an event that happened in the 2010s where many scientific studies were found to have errors even when replicated with great care. The Epistemic Crisis in the United States is a weakening of the ability of social institutions to persuade a large number of the population that they are legitimate. In general, it is bad when institutions are powerful but not persuasive: Soviet Union had the means of production but not the widespread support to use them productively. In the case of the US, the erosion of support is being led by both the populist right and left. In theory, a normal political cycle would flip over to the other party and then some compromise and muddle through would occur.

In particular, we examine how LLMs will influence the ecosystem of media and simulacra that was already in deep fractal crisis before the appearance of LLMs. We begin by describing the epistemic crisis of the 21st century, a loss of public trust in experts, journalists, politicians, professionals, trades, and the public itself. This crisis has been exacerbated by the replication crisis in an increasing number of sciences, plagiarism, and other forms of fraud and manipulation. We then consider how LLMs can be expected to contribute positively and negatively to this crisis, focusing on how we can build systems that reduce the \"cognitive parasitic load\" borne by society from the memetic fertility of the Internet.\n\n\n\n\nEND REWRITE SAMPLE\n\n##### Sample: Goldwater rule\n\nYou are going to rewrite some short texts from a user named @EliezerYudkowsky on Twitter.

If you see a short sentence in the transcript that feels slightly unsatisfying, it is likely there was something more after it which just never came.

Only I fully understand what I mean when I write things like 'predawn hours or when I happen to be awake when I happen to be not busy'. I hope you are able to make sense of these.\n\n- I write long portions of dialogue that are almost like spoken verse. Sometimes these make sense and sometimes they do not. I hope you can figure out when I am trying to be clever and when I am just babbling.\n\n- I often get so carried away with my own writing that I end up with some passage that is almost like a poem, but it is hard to tell when this is happening.

Noise emerges from the interaction of multiple systems and controls and independent components trying to steer it, or parasitic systems which the components are trying to manage. Because humans are in large part equipped to recognize signal when there is noise, we have evolved the ability to gather information from the world around us and use it to build understanding about what is important, potentially vital to our survival. We have evolved an ability to reliably identify what is important enough for us to spend our cognitive resources on. \n\nThe noise of information around us is so great that it is necessary for us to have evolved a means of filtering it. Traditionally, one of the most common methods for filtering information has been via social structures, institutions, and organizations that are set up to gather information and make sense of it. Typically, they have included people who made a career of it, who spent their lives in service of the function of gathering information about whatever their domain was, and of making sense of it. \n\nWhen we gather information, we also naturally access it through the cultural prisms we have been raised with. Those cultural prisms include not only our own personal experiences, but also our \"epistemic communities.\" These are \"information communities\" that we have allowed ourselves to trust. We also share epistemic communities with people who we share cultural prisms with. Whereas we may have personally formed our own cultural prism as we have done so much in the past, we now must rely on information to become a part of our cultural prism now, as we are constantly bombarded in the tsunami of information of the age of the Internet. \n\nEpistemic communities are human historical thinking collectives which have accumulated value over time, which have developed in real history as people have lived their lives over time and have built structures that reflect their observations of the world to understand it better and to help them act within the flow of the world in ways that are advantageous. \n\nThe problem with such communities of information sharing and sense-making is that even if such communities are adequate at a certain moment, they are not ultimately inerr"]],"start1":10015,"start2":10015,"length1":12,"length2":2563}],"summary":" Improve Broad Soc","cache":false,"rating":true,"read":true,"parent":"31","children":[]},"33":{"id":"33","timestamp":1707200435374,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"REWRITE\n\nThe"],[1," theme of this essay is the relationship between LLMs and societal trust.

They see news and facts denied, and manufactured narratives. They see their governments and institutions completely fail to hold media accountable or rein in corporate power. They see professors and other actors of knowledge use tactics including censorship and appealing to the power of the state and other establishment to silence dissent or opposition to conventional wisdom. They see experts and journalists caught out repeatedly lying such that they are unable to tell who is lying and who is telling the truth. They witness history rewritten and identities dismantled or reconstituted. And they see that when something goes wrong, that the people who were supposed to prevent that from happening have not been punished or held to account but rather promoted further in the system and granted even greater power. This leads them to a deeper and more important question: Can they trust those same people not to repeat what they did before, and to what extent does that question apply to their entire life?\n\nSo what people think is happening in the world of media and narrative is this:\n\nIt is that the people in power are not protecting them from anything but rather are disseminating information designed to obscure and obfuscate from the populace what is happening in the world as they are not truthfully communicating the information they have. And they are doing this to ensure that the power stays as it is or even becomes more concentrated\n\nThis is a worldview that is widely held across the political spectrum by people who would otherwise be diametrically opposed to each other. It is increasingly held by people who are highly educated and knowledgeable but also by people who appear to be largely ignorant. People who are poverty stricken and those who are wealthy. It can be found in countries where the government is liberal and in ones where it is autocratic. People who are marginalized in their societies and those who are in complete control of the levers of power. It is found in scientists and artists and engineers and business people and people who make products and people who are users of products. This is to say that it is everywhere and it is everyone, because people have seen the truth about power and now they do not recognize it anymore.\n\nAll of this is precursory to understanding how large language models can be expected to contribute to this narrative crises. \n\nEND REWRITE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"]],"start1":10015,"start2":10015,"length1":12,"length2":2521}],"summary":" Journalists Informed","cache":false,"rating":true,"read":true,"parent":"31","children":[]},"35":{"id":"35","timestamp":1707200564609,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"REWRITE\n\nThe"],[1," transcription software is not perfect, some words are not transcribed correctly and you should infer what word was meant or structure your rewrite so you don't have to know.\n\nARTNIGHTMARE is a transparency simulator.
