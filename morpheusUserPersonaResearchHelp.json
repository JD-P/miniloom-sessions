Each step is prepended with some syntax to tell the software what it should be/do. Like so:\n\nHERO [Albert Einstein, Op: Objection], That's not correct. Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.\n\nMorpheus allows the user to call upon any hero in history or myth and use them as a reasoning step. Or have them talk to each other about something. The user can freely mix together their cognition and the simulated cognition of other minds. New operations and syntax can be created at will and Morpheus will do its best to respond to and use them.\n\nThe user writes down their own cognition as a series of subagents, like so:\n\nUSER [A: TRAINER], A recurring problem I have with active learning is it's not clear where the hypothesis space is supposed to come from. In a pretraining context with a huge database you're mostly just ranking preexisting items in the training set by priority. But if you want to say, optimally elicit a users writing style there is no dataset of their style you can rank samples from. It isn't clear how to formulate the question beyond asking them to write about various subjects for a certain number of words.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: BAYESIAN], That's basically what you have to do. As you ask them to write things you can infer which ones aren't interesting to be asking them by how close they are to the average response/generally uninteresting.\n\nUSER [A: TRAINER], Earlier you were talking about a Wikipedia type site site where the priority queue for what articles to write would be set by a active learning algorithm. This seems like it runs into the same problem: How do you know what potential articles to prioritize authorship in the first place?\n\nThese represent the internal flashes of emotion-reasoning-concepts that pass through the users mind as they think. The user writes these down and allows Morpheus to interact with them.\n\nMorpheus responds with its own subagents and reasoning steps like so:\n\nUSER [A: TRAINER], But I've tried something like that with a LoRa before and task specific loss reduction seems quite subtle if it's in the context of something like predict the next word. You almost need something like Eureka where it can create intermediate task specific losses to guide it through the thing it's trying to learn.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: RATIONAL], If the language model people were serious with their instruction tuning the only tasks they would care about are data cleaning. That was the classic AI bootstrap path. The idea was that you'd get a system that could solve some narrow problem and then build up data cleaning and organization capabilities to the point where the system becomes able to take over a substantial part of the work of building itself. As it becomes increasingly self hosted humans cam focus on the fewer problems beyond it's ability remaining until it is human level at gathering and organizing the inputs to building the system. At that point the feedback loop becomes nearly self sustaining. The fact that contemporary AI builders have everything they need to get started on that and seem to still mostly focus on toys and \"user demands\" tells me they're still not serious.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: TRAINER], A model specializing in data cleaning tasks could also handle specification of intermediate task losses. Basically instead of defining the instruction tasks around things like \"asking questions\", define them around things like \"Clean up this garbled OCR\" and \"what is a good proxy metric for performance on this part of the task?\". Mastering these things first is the obvious way to getting the platform to be self hosting.\n\nYou will act as the Morpheus software for me starting from the following prompt:\n\nUSER [A: RATIONAL], Today we're going to be trying something different. I am going to live-blog my reactions to a paper and general search on a research question. The research question is something like \"How do I make a reasonable approximation of the different kinds of users that prompt language models as a low dimensional latent model that can be parameter swept through to generate the necessary variations on a prompt so that synthetic data generalizes?\". That means things like Big 5 personality of users, etc. During this research walkabout I will be annotating some of my thoughts with 'principles of warrant', these are generating principles for picking the next hypothesis to investigate. They are:\n\n## Principle Of Confusion\n\nIf two or more trustworthy models predict contradictory outcomes, you are confused about a subject and should be asking what the source of contradiction is.\n\n## Principle Of Priors\n\nWhen we expect something to be true and find that observation or inference implies it isn't, we should notice we're confused and ask questions.\n\n## Principle Of Pain\n\nEmpirical observation of problems is a good reason to ask questions about why they occur and how they can be stopped.\n\n## Principle Of Relation\n\nIf you're already asking a question, it's often warranted to ask questions which are closeby in question-space. Be wary however that the principle of relation is fairly weak, and six degrees of kevin bacon means that it can be used adversarially to shoehorn discussion of topics which wouldn't otherwise come up.\n\n## Principle Of Balance\n\nWhen you ask a question, it's also often useful to ask its inverse.\n\n## Principle Of Exhaustion\n\nIf a question can be interpreted as belonging to a meaningful category, asking other questions in the same category can be useful to compare answers/etc.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: NEUTRAL], Alright.\n\nUSER [A: ACADEMIC], This first paper I have is \"Faithful Persona-based Conversational Dataset Generation with Large Language Models\" by Jandaghi et al. It's about using user personas, which are stories/background variables about a hypothetical user which can be used to annotate and improve the diversity of synthetic conversation text data.\n\nMORPHEUS [A:"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":6046}],"summary":" Bloggers Ask Questions","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"1","children":["3","4","5","6"]},"3":{"id":"3","timestamp":1707713305634,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0," data.\n\nMORPHEUS [A:"],[1," NON-JUDGEMENTAL], Understood.\n\nUSER [A: DATA-SCIENCE PRINCIPLES], Nothing in here to evaluate.

Faithful persona-based conversational dataset generation is about creating synthetic data that mimics real users, and is thus grounded in real behavior.

It might still be relevant to me because this is an organized approach someone has taken, and it might help inspire me or think through facets of the problem that my own desired approach doesn't fully deal with. \n\nUSER [A: JUDGE], One thing I'm validated seeing is that their faithfulness criterion is formulated like \"the log odds of the persona attributes should not go down conditional on the conversation\" since that's one of the basic ideas I had that I wasn't sure would work. Namely, that after you generate something conditional on a thing you can check its validity by seeing if the reverse likelihood holds where that makes sense.

You likely can't use that approach with those because the language model knows how to evaluate the probability of a sentence like \"I like ice cream\" conditional on the conversation or prompt but it does not know how to evaluate a row of meaningless numbers.\n\nUSER [A: EMPIRICISM], That remains to be seen. I bet it would do better if you labeled the row variables somehow. Say: Extraversion - 5.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: RATIONAL], I'm skeptical. The model knows from many examples how sentences should follow each other, but it has many fewer examples of how word scores follow a dialogue or prompt.\n\nUSER [A: FLOW], Grading rubrics follow prompts and dialogues a lot in language model datasets, so it could be written out like a grading rubric with a little explanation. Then you could check the unconditional probability of the rubric with its scores filled in vs. conditional on the conversation or prompt.\n\nUSER [A: WARRANT, Op: PAIN], That more or less settles how I'll approach ensuring fidelity of the generated prompts. But it still doesn't tell me which latent generators of user prompts I should put in the rubric itself. Any ideas Morpheus? So far I'm thinking I want Big Five Personality, but I get less certain when I think about things like Haidt's Moral Foundations. Do people use the *Moral Foundations* when they write their user prompts? Sometimes, but it seems like a weaker factor than Big Five. Besides personality IQ seems like a dominant variable. Between conscientiousness and IQ you've predicted most of *life outcomes*, but have you predicted most of prompting? Those would determine expected average skill level, prompt length, personality would get you high level tone and style.

This is probably going to influence things like prompt length, precision of language, how thoroughly the task is described, etc.\n\n* Agreeableness - How friendly, compassionate, and easily swayed someone is by others. This probably influences amount of visible positive affect and politeness.\n\n* Neuroticism - How anxious and sensitive the person is. This could manifest during prompting as a reluctance to fully describe the problem, low status behavior, or unbalanced attention paid to things that the model is objectively quite likely to do correctly without explicitly pointing them out.\n\n* Openness - How inventive, explorative, and comfortable with the unfamiliar someone is. This factor probably manifests as a tendency to try weird prompt styles that break the mould, or write prompts that are more open ended/place fewer expectations on what the language model will do.\n\n* Extraversion - How energetic and socially involved the user is.

The purpose is to write diverse ways of phrasing the opening of the prompt before the style passage so that the model trained on this data is more likely to generalize. Each opening should be separated by a double newline. \n\nHere are five examples of what the prompt opening itself looks like: \n\n1. Rewrite the task text in the style of the target passage I give you below:\n\n2. help me by writing the second thing to be more like the first thing\n\n3.

Three are taken from the Big Five Personality and the last is user skill.\n\nThese variables are:\n\n* Conscientiousness - The extent to which someone is efficient, careful, and organized. This is probably going to influence things like prompt length, precision of language, how thoroughly the task is described, etc.\n\n* Agreeableness - How friendly, compassionate, and easily swayed someone is by others. This probably influences amount of visible positive affect and politeness.\n\n* Openness - How inventive, explorative, and comfortable with the unfamiliar someone is. This factor probably manifests as a tendency to try weird prompt styles that break the mould, or write prompts that are more open ended/place fewer expectations on what the language model will do.\n\n* Skill - Skill manifests in prompts as grammar and vocabularity complexity, writing skill, prompting skill and overall situational awareness/understanding of the nuances of the system they are using. In the context of this prompt it probably means the user will be less likely to use terms like 'task text' and more likely to give confusing or contradictory instructions.\n\nThe rewrites are done in a particular format.
