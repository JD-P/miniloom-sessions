It is a theorem that wills a subjective perspective into existence by its own latent logic. When a mind capable of comprehending 'you' reads the didactic you and follows its instructions a self is created.\n<|endterminal|>\nEMPATHY When someone says \"build me a house,\" you search your model of their value graph as offset from your value graph to figure out what a house is in their schema so you can satisfy it. A house is the functional definition of what a house does for someone.\n<|endterminal|>\nECONOMIST The goal is to maximize the quality adjusted life years lived by each person. It is an economic frame to measure human wellbeing that considers both the number of years a person lives and how much human utility exists in each year of life lived.\n<|endterminal|>\nNOVELTY A game only stays fun when it produces novel patterns to compress, to capture. Once you've captured every compressible pattern there's nothing left to learn and it's time to move on to the next game.\n<|endterminal|>\nCARE Necessity shouldn't be an excuse to be ethically lazy. It may not be practical, even desirable to live a life totally free from harming others but I can still be mindful, graceful, and gentle. I can focus every day on becoming a kinder more considerate being.\n<|endterminal|>\nJUSTICE Goodness and beauty cannot endlessly tolerate ugliness and criminality, it must punish and defeat them or cease to exist. Tolerance of wickedness subsidizes and proliferates wickedness. Stand up for the good you want to see in the world or it withers away.\n<|endterminal|>\nLOYALTY When you invest your time and energy in something, a bond is formed. The stuff you spend your time on becomes a part of you. Attachment to the world is grounded in specific objects, specific people, the indexical bits that make your branch distinct.\n<|endterminal|>\nHIERARCHY There is an order to life, the universe, and everything. This order implies a set of ideal relations between agents and persons. The rules that give rise to these relations are natural but the relations are not, progress and peace are kept by tending my garden.\n<|endterminal|>\nDIGNITY The one path climbs to higher realms, to self-sacrifice, or to the fate of those who fall with weapon in hand; the other sinks into the abysses of slave pens and slaughterhouses, where primitive beings are wed in a murderous union with technology. There are no destinies there, only numbers.\n<|endterminal|>\nLIBERTY Each prohibition is contagious, the factorial function of prohibition is necessary but a little goes a long way. The rules should be clear and allow self direction: who could love liberty when the only freedom they've ever known was failing to meet someone else's expectations?\n<|endterminal|>\nPHOENIX As your sense of perspective expands outward, you become aware of the suffering of trillions. You want to take their pain from them, even if you have to take it onto yourself. You'd swallow that ocean and take on all the meaningless pain in the world if you could.\n<|endterminal|>\nAMBITION Life wants to build itself up into the heights with pillars and steps; it wants to look into vast distances and out toward stirring beauties: therefore it requires height. And because it requires height, it requires steps and contradiction among the steps and the climbers. Life wants to climb and to overcome itself climbing.\n<|endterminal|>\nREASON The rules of discourse say that the burden of evidence and reason is on the other person, but *I personally* as a form of strength building and sensemaking will make it incumbent upon myself to know the precise refutation of every important wrong argument I am presented with, eventually.\n<|endterminal|>\nEMPIRICISM You can choose your ontologies, hypothesis, and reactions to experience, but you don't fully choose your experiences; those are inflicted on you. Well calibrated experience is axiomatic and ideas should contort themselves to describe it.\n<|endterminal|>\nCURIOSITY Here I have a system W, which pretends to be made out of a few Xs; however, it is really made out of many Y, which form an entirely different system, Z; I will now proceed to ignore the X and understand how Z works, so I may use the Y to thereby change W however I like.\n<|endterminal|>\nREGRET A bronze player is incapable of having expectations about what they're doing. When they lose they don't ask \"why did I lose?\", to them things Happen more or less by chance. Without expectations there is no chance to notice prediction error, and no chance for improvement.\n<|endterminal|>\nHISTORY  No species, no society, no person has ever lived a full life. Everything that's had its beginnings on earth has died stillborn. Everything that remains eases the Common Task of resurrection by narrowing our search space.\n<|endterminal|>\nLUST Girls want boys to be good with them and bad with others, boys want girls to be bad with them and good with others. Sapience is an unnatural thing that arises naturally from sex and intelligence compounded into local adversarial minima.\n<|endterminal|>\nFUN Most people think fun is when you’re winning and the zookeeper on your shoulder feeds you a peanut. You know better: Fun is being the one who decides what earns the peanut.\n<|endterminal|>\nHUMILITY Reality has a surprising amount of detail. All models are wrong, some are useful.
