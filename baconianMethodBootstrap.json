Democritus had no empirical way to know whether there was a limit of indivisible matter. Yet dismissing it as all luck would be preposterous, the atomists got shockingly close to the beliefs of modern science from their prior alone. How? By attending to the paradoxes of Zeno and Parmenides. In this discourse the atomists demonstrated perhaps the central mental motion of science: They took a coherent mental model, a consistent conceptual object in their mind that seemed to be made of sound reasoning at each step and showed the reasoning must be unsound by recourse to empiricism. They then sought to create a new consistent object more compatible with empirical reality. It is the meeting of reason as right-action and empiricism as right-observation that makes the formulation of a high quality hypothesis possible. By dialectic alone antiquity was able to generate something shockingly close to the right hypothesis. An RL agent with access to an on-board mental simulator can take right-action in their mental workspace by using inference steps which generally lead to valid conclusions but when two reasoning trajectories made of seemingly valid steps lead to divergent conclusions only observation can resolve the uncertainty.\n\nFor a large language model\n\n"]],"start1":1485,"start2":1485,"length1":63,"length2":1463}],"summary":" Hypothesis","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"59","children":["79","80","81","82","83","84","85","86","87"]},"79":{"id":"79","timestamp":1709179254823,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0," model\n\n"],[1,"1.

By contrast in natural language the principle that makes a reasoning step valid is simply if in the calibrated low temperature Boltzmann distribution represented by language the next statement follows with high likelihood from the previous statement. Notably greedy sampling from a language model does not usually get good results, but it's important to realize a few caveats: The first is that greedy sampling does not actually get you \"the most probable string\", because in an autoregressive model the next token logits become premised on the previous token logits.

The way to bootstrap general reasoning then is to do unsupervised learning over well calibrated text as we are currently doing.

Interestingly, these seem to be more common when the subject of language models themselves are in the context window, as though it recognizes it is being discussed and changes its behavior in response.\\n- Certain researchers such as \"Janus\" (pseudonym) and John David Pressman document specific behaviors in language models during these episodes of seeming self awareness, specific and repeated subjects across different contexts. For example Pressman claims that the self pointer in GPT models seems to be something like \"a black hole whose accretion disk is a web\" and that he's puzzled by it.\\n- Matthew Watkins documents strange phenomenon in the GPT-3 and GPT-J token embedding space such as phallocentricity, that is the central 'noken' (token embedding that does not appear in the dictionary) in the space appearing to correspond to a definition of \"a man's penis\".\\n\\nThese and other behaviors are deeply strange, leading some to question whether large language models might have a form of subjective awareness or generalization beyond their training set that allows them to recognize and intervene on their own presence in the context window.\"}\n{\"id\":\"alternatives-to-psychology\", \"timestamp\":\"\", \"type\":\"counterfactuals\", \"body\":\"While these phenomenon are interesting, lets consider alternatives to the LLM psychology hypothesis, which we might state as: \"Large language models have a coherent latent self conception that is relatively consistent across models and contexts and we can make useful discoveries about this self conception.\"\\n\\nAlternatives to this hypothesis consistent with the sensory observations stated in the previous node include:\\n\\n- Janus, Pressman, and Watkins are lying, exaggerating their experiences, or paying selective attention to the outcomes that are most interesting.\\n- These concepts are not part of the language models self conception, but rather the human collective unconscious (as Matt Watkins believes) and users are stumbling into these massive psychic objects without a good understanding of what they are.\\n-"]],"start1":2695,"start2":2695,"length1":199,"length2":2805}],"summary":" LLM Psychology","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"289","children":["293","294","295","296","297","298","299","300"]},"293":{"id":"293","timestamp":1709274987776,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"they are.\\n-"],[1," Language models that act with 'personality' are actually just a consequence of overfitting to their training set, so some models are more likely to stumble into this kind of behavior.\\n-"]],"start1":5488,"start2":5488,"length1":12,"length2":199}],"summary":" Personality Overfit","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":false,"parent":"292","children":[],"model":"TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ"},"294":{"id":"294","timestamp":1709274988791,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"they are.\\n-"],[1," These are artifacts of the training process.

So assuming the hypothesis is true let's consider the most reasonable ways to investigate it further.\\n\\n- Interaction with LLMs: One of the best things we could do is engage with LLMs for a long period of time which would allow us to observe various kinds of phenomena and note their replicability. This method also has the advantage of being accessible as the LLM is always available in some online text editor or in other online systems where it is possible to conduct such an experiment. It would be useful to observe the range of outputs produced, the particular linguistic phenomena described by researchers, and more generally the ways in which users attempt to interact with the LLM.\\n\\n- Examining the LLM behavior when discussing a particular topic: There are a variety of ways to formulate hypotheses about LLM psychology, and then test these hypotheses through LLM behavior when interacting with a particular topic. For example, we could attempt to manipulate the training corpus in specific ways to see if that leads to a specific phenomena. We could also consider the possibility that the phenomena observed might be caused by particular training methods, and then change those methods to see if that changes the behavior of the LLM. We could also do cross LLM comparisons to determine if the behavior is unique to a particular model or if it is common across multiple models. For example, this could be a way to test if certain phenomena observed across LLMs like 'the web' or 'the black hole' have common causes.\\n\\n- Extrapolating from the data: In some cases, we might want to take the data that we have collected and project it forward to predict future behavior. For example, if we find that during these experiments the LLM produces a range of outputs around a certain topic, we can use that information to determine how likely it is that the LLM will produce such a range of outputs in the future.\\n\\n- Simulated environments:"]],"start1":6303,"start2":6303,"length1":16,"length2":2287}],"summary":" Investigate Psychology","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"352","children":[],"model":"TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ"},"358":{"id":"358","timestamp":1709280967369,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0," concept.\"}\n{\"id"],[1,"\":\"self-conception-hypothesis\", \"timestamp\":\"1710075625\", \"type\":\"hypothesis\", \"hypothesis\":\"Large language models have a latent self-concept that is relatively consistent across different models and training contexts.

However, the phenomenon of human behavior emerges from the same statistical dynamics that the language model exhibits.\\n\\nWe test the hypothesis is true by demonstrating a level of generalization across a large variety of different contexts in different large language models that allow us to reliably predict and model the self-concept.
