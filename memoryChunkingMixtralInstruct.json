This implies that 'moments' from a decisionmaking standpoint occur 3-4 times a second.\n\nThe average English speaker speaks at a rate of about 4 syllables a second.\n\nIn general when measured across its various modalities, humans are found to only consciously retain about 40-60 bits of information per second. If we assume that the human brain encodes information at the size of about a syllable or word in its embeddings, this would imply about 16 bits of raw information in the vein of the GPT tokenizer. \n\n60 / 16 = 3.75\n\nOr again, humans produce about 3-4 tokens a second. This essential bottleneck is interesting because the phenomenon of memory chunking also implies humans store information in fundamental units of roughly that size. If so, the production of these embeddings must be deeply important since it introduces a serial bottleneck into the overall human cognition. The brain is also clearly able to recall strings of these embeddings readily and combine them into larger units of information, implying that the brain has an embedding scheme with the memory economy of raw GPT tokens and the retrieval efficiency of more expensive deep net embedding schemes.
