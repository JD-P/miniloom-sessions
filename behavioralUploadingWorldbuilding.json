{"loomTree":{"root":{"id":1,"timestamp":1702367722661,"type":"root","patch":"","summary":"Root Node","cache":"USER [A: AUTHOR], The basic idea for the story is that as people come to realize that their mind pattern can be instantiated outside their body just by recording enough information about their life that a tension is created between personal secret keeping and the desire not to die. People continue to have a right to privacy, but increasingly exercising it means literally dying in obscurity when you could otherwise have a vastly better chance of continuing into the future in some form. What I'm having trouble with is fleshing this out as a *setting*. It feels like the future is going to have so many changes from now in a fairly short period of time in relatively unpredictable ways that it's difficult not to write something with extreme zeerust.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPIRICISM], Realistically the settings that are most immune to zeerust are the ones that have a strong enough internal logic that we can accept them as a reality on their own terms, rather than a failure to derive or predict our reality. Given a strong enough set of conditional premises, if the predictions in the story reasonably follow from those premises I don't think people fault the author for having made them. It lets you bound the mistakes to a set of crucial assumptions.\n\nUSER [A: RATIONAL], That makes sense. I guess the real question then is what are my core assumptions/predictions? Off the top of my head:\n\n- It will become obvious to intelligent people that mind patterns can be reconstructed from a lot less information than classical transhumanists are used to assuming because the information between minds is highly redundant. If there are natural abstractions, convergent representations and shared understandings between people then the contents of Wikipedia alone are a good first-pass stab at how any given educated person in 2023 views the world. It doesn't matter if your experiences are different, or you have different semantic associations, or your brain isn't wired exactly the same way, so long as you can *narrow the hypothesis space enough* of what those parameters are you can infer them to a close enough degree to get a mind pattern out of someones head. Every bit of information you have beyond the Wikipedia or general distribution over multimodal representations is a potential narrowing towards the actual mind pattern of a person.\n\n- People will have a variety of reactions to this, and as always the future is not evenly distributed. Some people will take a lo-fi upload of themselves as being basically them, others will have objections that it's merely a copy but their thread of phenomenological experience will die, others will have religious objections (though fewer than you'd think) that being copied delays their entry into heaven, and in general it will not be taken as seriously as it probably should be, at least not at first. It's important to remember that for all of human history, for all of the history of sentient life even death has been inevitable and our ways of dealing with death have been various elaborate forms of coping mechanism. So the general way that most people will engage with this possibility, if they do so at all, will be the way they engage with other forms of fanciful musing about death and coping mechanisms. Only a few will see the real opportunity for any kind of extended lifespan.\n\n- The practice will probably not be banned, at least in the United States. This is both because the US has robust free speech protections (for now, this could change in the future if the more illiberal younger generations gain enough political power) and because developmentally we can already see in our timeline that the first real uses of this technology will be to speak with the deceased, rather than 1st party attempts by people to prolong their own life. It will be seen as low status to have a simulacrum of a departed loved one created because it implies the inability to let go, but it will also be seen as cruel to intervene because it's essentially kicking someone when they're down during the grieving process. \n\n- As models become better, finetunes of them based on peoples mannerisms, writing, ideas, brain scans, etc will get closer and closer to a 'real' interaction with them. This means that as the fidelity gets better it will be less and less obviously pathetic to create and interact with behavioral uploads of the deceased. That means you'll have an industry dedicated to collecting the data for and creating these simulacrum during a dying persons remaining time so their loved ones can continue to interact with them as they pass. In their quest for greater fidelity, the creators of these simulacrum will probe deeper and deeper into the lives of the person whose mind pattern they are attempting to record. \n\n- The story starts with an interaction between a team collecting this data and someone who has done bad things. It doesn't particularly matter what bad things they've done, and the bad things are mostly not grand criminal conspiracy, but perhaps the petty kinds of bad things which silently happen but people aren't used to talking about out loud. The grandmother who admits to the times she beat her son, or an out loud recollection of a toxic relationship they had, or a time they didn't do the right thing by someone they knew. These are awkward and illustrate the core conflict of the story: A form of at least symbolic Beckerian immortality increasingly running up against the heretofore known norms of privacy and secrecy that people have practiced. In a sense everyone who wants you to keep a secret will be asking you to promise your secrecy in exchange for a very literal piece of your soul.\n\nThat's kind of the basic premise, and then I'm sort of trying to worldbuild and figure out characters and what kind of story in this setting, what thing or thing that could happen is most interesting to the reader.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: SOCIOLOGY], One thing that stands out to me reading that is the kind of parallel you have with the myth of Christian confession and the idea that you need to confess your sins to be let into heaven. I suspect the original idea there was to create something like the dynamic you're describing, except that had to be taken on faith whereas this conflict is very real, and therefore probably a lot more potent.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], Absolutely. It would also be a great frustration to the teams collecting this data, because from their perspective they probably do not care about whatever you did (unless it was truly heinous), because by this point they've heard just about everything. A bit like the dynamic between Dr. House and his patients in House M.D. where House simply does not care that his patients are cheating on their wife or that someone has an addiction to nitrous oxide, what he cares about is curing the patient and their personal secrets and lying impulses are getting in the way of that. After a certain point he does start to care, but mostly because he's so deeply annoyed by having to probe and dig just to help people. I could see at least some teams developing an attitude like that.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: ECONOMIST/EMPATHY], Possibly, but it's important to remember that House is fiction for a reason and bedside manner remains the best selling trait a doctor can have. Someone who gets *truly* bothered by this probably can't stay in the business very long, because they would alienate people and lose clients. I imagine that these people would need to be almost infinitely patient, because you're essentially asking them to tell you their life story. This is both a sensitive, deeply personal subject, but also one with a lot of detail. You simply couldn't do the job if you weren't willing to become engrossed, to chase down every little detail, weren't charismatic and sensitive enough to get people to open up to you. When someone is confessing a bad thing and you really need them to keep talking to get a proper recording from them the last thing you're going to do is be callous to them. In that moment you need the person to trust you, and you have to at least pretend like you're emotionally affected and forgive them even though it's not really your place to forgive.\n\nUSER [A: JUDGE], No you're right, that sounds much more like how someone would need to be to do this job effectively. It also kind of ties into the theme of at least the first section of the story (maybe the only section?), which is that if this persons actions are criminal they're only incidentally criminal. In the embryonic stage it's much less about the conflict between the person confessing and society, because remember that society doesn't really take this technology seriously yet. Rather it's about the conflict between the persons self image they curate and expose to others, and what that person is really like if you take into account their whole self, if they were actually forced to be honest about their actions and intentions over their whole life history. Nobody is perfect, and the average person is not necessarily a good person, realistically if you take them as a whole being they're probably kind of a bad person. But everyone tells a story about themselves to make them feel better, and in the embryonic stage the conflict is between the desire for an accurate reconstruction and the subjects desire to not own up to who they are.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPIRICISM], So what do you see differentiating this story from say, a fictional dialogue between a caretaker and a dying person confessing their life story to them out of half-boredom? That is, where does the interest come from here beyond just the idea of someone telling their life story.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], It's interesting to me because it forces the reader to contemplate the same questions, they have to resolve their own feelings about the subject in close connection with their feelings about themselves. In most stories you're not directly confronted, there's an element of separation that keeps you feeling safe. But here the reader is forced to consider the way they live their life by the idea that in the future they may deeply desire to tell people about it and not feel able to. Will they observe they have the capacity to describe their life honestly to someone else, or will they realize that to actually fully explain it to another person would make them unsympathetic?\n\nUSER [A: RATIONAL], To go back to what you said earlier about Christian confession, I've pointed out before that the Internet kind of selects for the opposite of Christian confession. Instead of starting with the ways in which you're flawed and could improve, you can farm sympathy from strangers by talking to them about the ways others are hurting you. This leads to an environment where it's very easy to vent out your traumas around things that were done to you, but not around the things that you did to others.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: ECONOMIST], You think people are traumatized by what they do to others? What incentive would they have for that?\n\nUSER [A: EMPATHY], At least sometimes? You can nearly define trauma as anything you would have trouble confessing. It's very easy to develop a victim complex when every time you recognize the ways in which you're being treated inferior you get outpourings of sympathy, but when you're the tyrant or bully you learn to repress awareness of it. What's actually happened is that certain kinds of confession have become nearly free while others have become more expensive than ever. This is part of why therapy-speak has been completely normalized, it's no longer nearly as costly as it once was to admit weakness. So a story that can get people to really think about their whole life, that gets them in the frame of \"alright so I'm going to speak the index over all the memories in my life-oh, OH\", that seems like it could be productive for a lot of reasons but one of the bigger ones is that you realize you've been repressing this particular dynamic that way.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: FOCUS], Getting back towards the object level plot I imagine part of the difficulty on the part of the team or funeral director doing this is that they have to dig fairly deep. Not just a matter of asking the person questions, but doing research, going back and finding artifacts or settings to prompt them for the right things. The older someone gets the harder it becomes for them to remember things without props and artifacts to help them. Going through their life month by month and asking them what happened in this week, what were you doing here, how did you feel about this? Asking surviving friends and family for their part of the story, in fact maybe that could be a large part of the frame narrative? You could have the same persons life described from multiple perspectives through the people around them, and how this ties into the way they're remembered but also how the team chooses to prompt them for more information. The ambiguity that arises when you go beyond someones autobiographical recollection to other sources of information about their life.\n\nUSER [A: HISTORIAN], The idea of prompting with props and artifacts is interesting. It reminds me a bit of things like Egyptian tombs where they would kind of prepare the dying noble with things they would need for the afterlife, goods and slaves. I imagine this project of scanning in all the surviving relics from a life. Not just the photos and papers, but physical objects 3D scanned so they can be used as part of recreated settings and rooms. Making entire 3D reconstructions of various places based on the subjects description, these would be AI generated so they respond in a feedback loop to the subject saying that something is in the wrong place or incorrectly depicted. These reconstructions could later be used to 'house' and comfort the upload themselves.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: HISTORIAN], Not just that but again consider the implications of having multiple people that you interview about the same place and time. How do you handle conflicts? Obviously the subjects memories are going to take 1st priority since you're trying to reconstruct their mind pattern not what actually happened per se. On the other hand to get a good sense of what *did* happen, in order to impute data you're going to be constantly balancing what you know to have been the case with what someone says that strictly speaking did not happen. \n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], Plot wise I'm reminded a bit of S-Town, where the focus becomes the web of relationships John B. McLemore had to the other people in the town. You get a different impression of John from what other people have to say about him, and the reporters own investigations into the things John says. John is very much an unreliable narrator, and it becomes clear just how unreliable as the reporter is pulled deeper and deeper into the surreal aftershocks that ripple through the town as a result of his death. In that sense maybe the genre is closer to that of a detective story? We can imagine a fascinating subject, a beautiful person who is simultaneously tragic somehow and the narrator or person assigned to record their life is left pulling their hair out trying to put the pieces together.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: RATIONAL], It makes sense, though I would note that this seems to be drifting away from your original idea of a story about the conflict between immortality through oversharing and peoples desire for secrecy or privacy.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], It doesn't have to be a complete departure. I see plenty of room to explore that theme, especially if a lot of the people that the 'reporter' (we really need a better name for the person doing this investigative work to reconstruct the subjects life) talks to don't like that they're doing it. In many ways we can imagine...if you try to upload your life into a computer like this you are implicitly trying to capture into a legible recorded medium every interaction you can remember with other people. That means nothing anyone has ever done with in your life was ever truly private. I could see that feeling like a betrayal, and for this sense of betrayal to be one of the core barriers that the investigator has to work around.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: POSTMODERNIST], There's also a natural tie-in to the concept of a panopticon. Each 'betrayal' as you put it makes people more paranoid about further revelations from people they interact with. Imagine the drama if someone dies *early*, like if they get cancer in their 20's or 30's and want to go through this process, just how much extra drama is it going to cause if all the stuff that person was involved in is suddenly being legibly recorded in mediums subject to legal seizure? Is it a violation of your rights if after you die the state seizes your memories to do whatever they want with them? After all you're dead, and it's not like anyone is being deprived if they make a copy. The 3rd party doctrine says that the people you interact with don't really get a say(?), seems like that point alone could have a lot of juice in it.\n\nUSER [A: IMPERIAL], Given everything I've said, use your imagination and come up with a couple specific plots that could fit my worldbuilding.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: CREATIVE], Sure, though keep in mind we're still at the sketch stage so these are short synopsis:\n\n1. A woman in the process of being behaviorally uploaded is interrupted by her sudden murder. When the uploader boots up her simulacrum at the eulogy it accuses a specific guest of being her murderer. A detective has to solve the crime with the aid of the deceased's own digital ghost.\n\n2. Someone undergoing behavioral uploading as part of end-of-life care is brought back into contact with their estranged family. The family's attempts to keep a dark secret undermine the process, bringing the uploader and their client into a protracted conflict.\n\n3. A wealthy business tycoon has as close a clone to their mind made as money can buy so they can continue to manage their businesses and foundations even after they're gone. The tycoon accumulates unheard of wealth and wisdom as their accounts continue to accrue money. In the process they and their fellow uploads incite riots against growing wealth inequality and the cultural mismatch between the managers of society and its citizens.\n\n4. A highly religious old woman is bought behavioral uploading services by her loving grandchildren who adore her. During the process she is asked to interact with the in-progress simulacrum of herself and becomes increasingly disturbed by it. Already in the process of grappling with her faith, her disturbance is increased tenfold when her ratings of what is and isn't her own likeness conflict with the grandchildrens evaluations of grandma's upload.\n\n5. Two lovers want their love to last forever no matter what might happen in the future. They arrange to have their own behavioral uploads made. At first everything goes smoothly, but then one partner discovers something unacceptable in the other partners upload. The other partner can't bring themselves (or is legally unable) to delete the simulacrum and so finds an outlet for vengeance.\n\n6. A group of friends have their simulacrums made together and then go on a group honeymoon. While traveling they have a huge crisis, and try to make their way back to the uploaders. Unfortunately, they discover they're the uploads and aren't ready to be released just yet.\n\n7. An ambitious young woman tries to fake her own death in order to get an early behavioral uploading. This could be because the process is illegal unless you're dying (unlikely in the US) or because her family will only pay for/consent to give their crucial knowledge for it if they think she's gone. She succeeds, but her friends and family quickly realize the ploy. Her family sues to stop her uploads release.\n\nUSER [A: INSIGHT], I really like 4 but kind of feel like it gets away from the original idea of the conflict between the incentive to overshare and the incentive to keep the things people tell you in confidence private. But then it hit me: What if the subject being uploaded is themselves something like a priest or a psychologist and part of the difficulty is that they've been entrusted with so much of other peoples confidential thoughts and experiences. I'm particularly enamored with the idea of someone having a confessional with their own mirror image.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPATHETIC], Yes, and what's fascinating about that is that in a sense if you want to preserve your subjectivity, one must take steps to ensure it remains a mirror. The fact that the recording process is a betrayal of privacy in itself should cause it to self correct and filter out many sensitive things. You'll be careful what you say in the presence of the simulacrum, because even as it recreates your thoughts and conversations, you cannot count on it recreating the same amount of privacy that you expect. \n\nUSER [A: INTERPRETATIONIST], It may be a betrayal of privacy, but it doesn't have to be. One could argue that, in fact, the most meaningful memories are precisely the ones that are open, available and shared. By the same token, one could posit that one reason we do not share and live those most important connections in our lives is precisely the risk that someone might reveal them to the world, and that this fear is ultimately a form of weakness and cowardice.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: HISTORIAN], Yes and no.

In many ways we can imagine...if you try to upload your life into a computer like this you are implicitly trying to capture into a legible recorded medium every interaction you can remember with other people. That means nothing anyone has ever done with in your life was ever truly private. I could see that feeling like a betrayal, and for this sense of betrayal to be one of the core barriers that the investigator has to work around.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: POSTMODERNIST], There's also a natural tie-in to the concept of a panopticon. Each 'betrayal' as you put it makes people more paranoid about further revelations from people they interact with. Imagine the drama if someone dies *early*, like if they get cancer in their 20's or 30's and want to go through this process, just how much extra drama is it going to cause if all the stuff that person was involved in is suddenly being legibly recorded in mediums subject to legal seizure? Is it a violation of your rights if after you die the state seizes your memories to do whatever they want with them? After all you're dead, and it's not like anyone is being deprived if they make a copy. The 3rd party doctrine says that the people you interact with don't really get a say(?), seems like that point alone could have a lot of juice in it.\n\nUSER [A: IMPERIAL], Given everything I've said, use your imagination and come up with a couple specific plots that could fit my worldbuilding.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: CREATIVE], Sure, though keep in mind we're still at the sketch stage so these are short synopsis:\n\n1. A woman in the process of being behaviorally uploaded is interrupted by her sudden murder. When the uploader boots up her simulacrum at the eulogy it accuses a specific guest of being her murderer. A detective has to solve the crime with the aid of the deceased's own digital ghost.\n\n2. Someone undergoing behavioral uploading as part of end-of-life care is brought back into contact with their estranged family. The family's attempts to keep a dark secret undermine the process, bringing the uploader and their client into a protracted conflict.\n\n3. A wealthy business tycoon has as close a clone to their mind made as money can buy so they can continue to manage their businesses and foundations even after they're gone. The tycoon accumulates unheard of wealth and wisdom as their accounts continue to accrue money. In the process they and their fellow uploads incite riots against growing wealth inequality and the cultural mismatch between the managers of society and its citizens.\n\n4. A highly religious old woman is bought behavioral uploading services by her loving grandchildren who adore her. During the process she is asked to interact with the in-progress simulacrum of herself and becomes increasingly disturbed by it. Already in the process of grappling with her faith, her disturbance is increased tenfold when her ratings of what is and isn't her own likeness conflict with the grandchildrens evaluations of grandma's upload.\n\n5. Two lovers want their love to last forever no matter what might happen in the future. They arrange to have their own behavioral uploads made. At first everything goes smoothly, but then one partner discovers something unacceptable in the other partners upload. The other partner can't bring themselves (or is legally unable) to delete the simulacrum and so finds an outlet for vengeance.\n\n6. A group of friends have their simulacrums made together and then go on a group honeymoon. While traveling they have a huge crisis, and try to make their way back to the uploaders. Unfortunately, they discover they're the uploads and aren't ready to be released just yet.\n\n7. An ambitious young woman tries to fake her own death in order to get an early behavioral uploading. This could be because the process is illegal unless you're dying (unlikely in the US) or because her family will only pay for/consent to give their crucial knowledge for it if they think she's gone. She succeeds, but her friends and family quickly realize the ploy. Her family sues to stop her uploads release.\n\nUSER [A: INSIGHT], I really like 4 but kind of feel like it gets away from the original idea of the conflict between the incentive to overshare and the incentive to keep the things people tell you in confidence private. But then it hit me: What if the subject being uploaded is themselves something like a priest or a psychologist and part of the difficulty is that they've been entrusted with so much of other peoples confidential thoughts and experiences. I'm particularly enamored with the idea of someone having a confessional with their own mirror image.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPATHETIC], Yes, and what's fascinating about that is that in a sense if you want to preserve your subjectivity, one must take steps to ensure it remains a mirror. The fact that the recording process is a betrayal of privacy in itself should cause it to self correct and filter out many sensitive things. You'll be careful what you say in the presence of the simulacrum, because even as it recreates your thoughts and conversations, you cannot count on it recreating the same amount of privacy that you expect. \n\nUSER [A: INTERPRETATIONIST], It may be a betrayal of privacy, but it doesn't have to be. One could argue that, in fact, the most meaningful memories are precisely the ones that are open, available and shared. By the same token, one could posit that one reason we do not share and live those most important connections in our lives is precisely the risk that someone might reveal them to the world, and that this fear is ultimately a form of weakness and cowardice.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: HISTORIAN], Yes and no. I don'","rating":null,"read":true,"parent":null,"children":["2"]},"2":{"id":"2","timestamp":1702371357469,"type":"user","patch":[{"diffs":[[1,"USER [A: AUTHOR], The basic idea for the story is that as people come to realize that their mind pattern can be instantiated outside their body just by recording enough information about their life that a tension is created between personal secret keeping and the desire not to die. People continue to have a right to privacy, but increasingly exercising it means literally dying in obscurity when you could otherwise have a vastly better chance of continuing into the future in some form. What I'm having trouble with is fleshing this out as a *setting*. It feels like the future is going to have so many changes from now in a fairly short period of time in relatively unpredictable ways that it's difficult not to write something with extreme zeerust.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPIRICISM], Realistically the settings that are most immune to zeerust are the ones that have a strong enough internal logic that we can accept them as a reality on their own terms, rather than a failure to derive or predict our reality. Given a strong enough set of conditional premises, if the predictions in the story reasonably follow from those premises I don't think people fault the author for having made them. It lets you bound the mistakes to a set of crucial assumptions.\n\nUSER [A: RATIONAL], That makes sense. I guess the real question then is what are my core assumptions/predictions? Off the top of my head:\n\n- It will become obvious to intelligent people that mind patterns can be reconstructed from a lot less information than classical transhumanists are used to assuming because the information between minds is highly redundant. If there are natural abstractions, convergent representations and shared understandings between people then the contents of Wikipedia alone are a good first-pass stab at how any given educated person in 2023 views the world. It doesn't matter if your experiences are different, or you have different semantic associations, or your brain isn't wired exactly the same way, so long as you can *narrow the hypothesis space enough* of what those parameters are you can infer them to a close enough degree to get a mind pattern out of someones head. Every bit of information you have beyond the Wikipedia or general distribution over multimodal representations is a potential narrowing towards the actual mind pattern of a person.\n\n- People will have a variety of reactions to this, and as always the future is not evenly distributed. Some people will take a lo-fi upload of themselves as being basically them, others will have objections that it's merely a copy but their thread of phenomenological experience will die, others will have religious objections (though fewer than you'd think) that being copied delays their entry into heaven, and in general it will not be taken as seriously as it probably should be, at least not at first. It's important to remember that for all of human history, for all of the history of sentient life even death has been inevitable and our ways of dealing with death have been various elaborate forms of coping mechanism. So the general way that most people will engage with this possibility, if they do so at all, will be the way they engage with other forms of fanciful musing about death and coping mechanisms. Only a few will see the real opportunity for any kind of extended lifespan.\n\n- The practice will probably not be banned, at least in the United States. This is both because the US has robust free speech protections (for now, this could change in the future if the more illiberal younger generations gain enough political power) and because developmentally we can already see in our timeline that the first real uses of this technology will be to speak with the deceased, rather than 1st party attempts by people to prolong their own life. It will be seen as low status to have a simulacrum of a departed loved one created because it implies the inability to let go, but it will also be seen as cruel to intervene because it's essentially kicking someone when they're down during the grieving process. \n\n- As models become better, finetunes of them based on peoples mannerisms, writing, ideas, brain scans, etc will get closer and closer to a 'real' interaction with them. This means that as the fidelity gets better it will be less and less obviously pathetic to create and interact with behavioral uploads of the deceased. That means you'll have an industry dedicated to collecting the data for and creating these simulacrum during a dying persons remaining time so their loved ones can continue to interact with them as they pass. In their quest for greater fidelity, the creators of these simulacrum will probe deeper and deeper into the lives of the person whose mind pattern they are attempting to record. \n\n- The story starts with an interaction between a team collecting this data and someone who has done bad things. It doesn't particularly matter what bad things they've done, and the bad things are mostly not grand criminal conspiracy, but perhaps the petty kinds of bad things which silently happen but people aren't used to talking about out loud. The grandmother who admits to the times she beat her son, or an out loud recollection of a toxic relationship they had, or a time they didn't do the right thing by someone they knew. These are awkward and illustrate the core conflict of the story: A form of at least symbolic Beckerian immortality increasingly running up against the heretofore known norms of privacy and secrecy that people have practiced. In a sense everyone who wants you to keep a secret will be asking you to promise your secrecy in exchange for a very literal piece of your soul.\n\nThat's kind of the basic premise, and then I'm sort of trying to worldbuild and figure out characters and what kind of story in this setting, what thing or thing that could happen is most interesting to the reader.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: SOCIOLOGY], One thing that stands out to me reading that is the kind of parallel you have with the myth of Christian confession and the idea that you need to confess your sins to be let into heaven. I suspect the original idea there was to create something like the dynamic you're describing, except that had to be taken on faith whereas this conflict is very real, and therefore probably a lot more potent.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], Absolutely. It would also be a great frustration to the teams collecting this data, because from their perspective they probably do not care about whatever you did (unless it was truly heinous), because by this point they've heard just about everything. A bit like the dynamic between Dr. House and his patients in House M.D. where House simply does not care that his patients are cheating on their wife or that someone has an addiction to nitrous oxide, what he cares about is curing the patient and their personal secrets and lying impulses are getting in the way of that. After a certain point he does start to care, but mostly because he's so deeply annoyed by having to probe and dig just to help people. I could see at least some teams developing an attitude like that.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: ECONOMIST/EMPATHY], Possibly, but it's important to remember that House is fiction for a reason and bedside manner remains the best selling trait a doctor can have. Someone who gets *truly* bothered by this probably can't stay in the business very long, because they would alienate people and lose clients. I imagine that these people would need to be almost infinitely patient, because you're essentially asking them to tell you their life story. This is both a sensitive, deeply personal subject, but also one with a lot of detail. You simply couldn't do the job if you weren't willing to become engrossed, to chase down every little detail, weren't charismatic and sensitive enough to get people to open up to you. When someone is confessing a bad thing and you really need them to keep talking to get a proper recording from them the last thing you're going to do is be callous to them. In that moment you need the person to trust you, and you have to at least pretend like you're emotionally affected and forgive them even though it's not really your place to forgive.\n\nUSER [A: JUDGE], No you're right, that sounds much more like how someone would need to be to do this job effectively. It also kind of ties into the theme of at least the first section of the story (maybe the only section?), which is that if this persons actions are criminal they're only incidentally criminal. In the embryonic stage it's much less about the conflict between the person confessing and society, because remember that society doesn't really take this technology seriously yet. Rather it's about the conflict between the persons self image they curate and expose to others, and what that person is really like if you take into account their whole self, if they were actually forced to be honest about their actions and intentions over their whole life history. Nobody is perfect, and the average person is not necessarily a good person, realistically if you take them as a whole being they're probably kind of a bad person. But everyone tells a story about themselves to make them feel better, and in the embryonic stage the conflict is between the desire for an accurate reconstruction and the subjects desire to not own up to who they are.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPIRICISM], So what do you see differentiating this story from say, a fictional dialogue between a caretaker and a dying person confessing their life story to them out of half-boredom? That is, where does the interest come from here beyond just the idea of someone telling their life story.\n\nUSER [A:"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":9668}],"summary":"Society Vs Individual","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":1,"children":["3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","69"]},"3":{"id":"3","timestamp":1702371494539,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"story.\n\nUSER [A:"],[1," COGITO], It seems like the question in this case then is much more about the story you would end up with at the end, and how that story would be evaluated and judged by society.

I've read a few different stories from people who have spent their life as assassins or terrorists and the way they look back on it is fascinating: They talk about how the training, the people and the experience was one of the only parts of their life they still love looking back on. They might hate what they did and how they came to do it, but the camaraderie and feeling of accomplishment they had was still real and valid for them.

But the deeper answer is really the motivation behind the story. The deeper answer is that the protagonist, the person who's building the recording, is trying to solve the mystery of their own identity. The story begins with the protagonist thinking they have a very bad person in their possession, someone not only of an ill intention but also with a life story that would shame or embarrass them. Maybe even implicate them in something illegal, which in this stage would be the real crime, the true evil act. The only thing worse than actually doing something bad is to pretend you're a good person by obscuring your real motives or covering up the bad things you may have done in your past.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: SOCIOLOGY], That's kind of the problem as I see it.

For that reason there would need to be an infrastructure devoted to this, the ethics of it would need to be addressed, the public would need to address it, etc. There would also be a whole new sector of society devoted to ensuring the quality of the recordings, doing data analysis, creating simulacrums, etc. So there is a sort of infrastructure that needs to be built. At the same time, because of the nature of the technology the simulation of each person would need to be as individualized as possible. It would need to be an accurate replication, a perfect copy of the person who's mind pattern is being uploaded.

That means that instead of them just telling a simple life story they have to tell a very complete life story that is rich with nuance and texture. They have to expose the parts of them they would not normally expose to someone they met, including any bad things they might have done in the past. I think this is where the conflict comes in.

The process is learned by inferring instrumental rewards over the text spans/sensory inputs that led to the reward state. The vector of real-valued rewards from our terminal reward ensemble can then be 'spread out' over the sensory spans that led up to the rewarded state based on their sequential distance from the reward. So if we have 8 spans that led to reward, the first span would get 1/8(?) the reward of the final span. Then when we want to replay these embeddings with retrieval augmented generation we order them using the decoder as an estimate of which goes in which order through their log odds.

If a embedding has a high score in this ensemble during a self-play episode we can infer instrumentals backwards from it as the latent program (or plan) implied by the sequence of discrete embeddings encoded from the sequence of tokens leading up to the reward.

So if we have 8 spans that led to reward, the first span would get 1/8(?) the reward of the final span.

Not just a matter of asking the person questions, but doing research, going back and finding artifacts or settings to prompt them for the right things. The older someone gets the harder it becomes for them to remember things without props and artifacts to help them. Going through their life month by month and asking them what happened in this week, what were you doing here, how did you feel about this? Asking surviving friends and family for their part of the story, in fact maybe that could be a large part of the frame narrative? You could have the same persons life described from multiple perspectives through the people around them, and how this ties into the way they're remembered but also how the team chooses to prompt them for more information. The ambiguity that arises when you go beyond someones autobiographical recollection to other sources of information about their life.\n\nUSER [A: HISTORIAN], The idea of prompting with props and artifacts is interesting. It reminds me a bit of things like Egyptian tombs where they would kind of prepare the dying noble with things they would need for the afterlife, goods and slaves. I imagine this project of scanning in all the surviving relics from a life. Not just the photos and papers, but physical objects 3D scanned so they can be used as part of recreated settings and rooms. Making entire 3D reconstructions of various places based on the subjects description, these would be AI generated so they respond in a feedback loop to the subject saying that something is in the wrong place or incorrectly depicted. These reconstructions could later be used to 'house' and comfort the upload themselves.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: HISTORIAN], Not just that but again consider the implications of having multiple people that you interview about the same place and time. How do you handle conflicts? Obviously the subjects memories are going to take 1st priority since you're trying to reconstruct their mind pattern not what actually happened per se. On the other hand to get a good sense of what *did* happen, in order to impute data you're going to be constantly balancing what you know to have been the case with what someone says that strictly speaking did not happen. \n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], Plot wise I'm reminded a bit of S-Town, where the focus becomes the web of relationships John B. McLemore had to the other people in the town. You get a different impression of John from what other people have to say about him, and the reporters own investigations into the things John says. John is very much an unreliable narrator, and it becomes clear just how unreliable as the reporter is pulled deeper and deeper into the surreal aftershocks that ripple through the town as a result of his death. In that sense maybe the genre is closer to that of a detective story? We can imagine a fascinating subject, a beautiful person who is simultaneously tragic somehow and the narrator or person assigned to record their life is left pulling their hair out trying to put the pieces together.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: RATIONAL], It makes sense, though I would note that this seems to be drifting away from your original idea of a story about the conflict between immortality through oversharing and peoples desire for secrecy or privacy.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], It doesn't have to be a complete departure. I see plenty of room to explore that theme, especially if a lot of the people that the 'reporter' (we really need a better name for the person doing this investigative work to reconstruct the subjects life) talks to don't like that they're doing it. In many ways we can imagine...if you try to upload your life into a computer like this you are implicitly trying to capture into a legible recorded medium every interaction you can remember with other people. That means nothing anyone has ever done with in your life was ever truly private. I could see that feeling like a betrayal, and for this sense of betrayal to be one of the core barriers that the investigator has to work around.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: POSTMODERNIST], There's also a natural tie-in to the concept of a panopticon. Each 'betrayal' as you put it makes people more paranoid about further revelations from people they interact with. Imagine the drama if someone dies *early*, like if they get cancer in their 20's or 30's and want to go through this process, just how much extra drama is it going to cause if all the stuff that person was involved in is suddenly being legibly recorded in mediums subject to legal seizure? Is it a violation of your rights if after you die the state seizes your memories to do whatever they want with them? After all you're dead, and it's not like anyone is being deprived if they make a copy. The 3rd party doctrine says that the people you interact with don't really get a say(?), seems like that point alone could have a lot of juice in it."]],"start1":11953,"start2":11953,"length1":8,"length2":5063}],"summary":"Concepts E","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"28","children":["38","39","40","41","42"]},"38":{"id":"38","timestamp":1702389996091,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"juice in it."],[1,"\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], I think we're definitely heading in a fascinating direction.

People continue to have a right to privacy, but increasingly exercising it means literally dying in obscurity when you could otherwise have a vastly better chance of continuing into the future in some form. What I'm having trouble with is fleshing this out as a *setting*. It feels like the future is going to have so many changes from now in a fairly short period of time in relatively unpredictable ways that it's difficult not to write something with extreme zeerust.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPIRICISM], Realistically the settings that are most immune to zeerust are the ones that have a strong enough internal logic that we can accept them as a reality on their own terms, rather than a failure to derive or predict our reality. Given a strong enough set of conditional premises, if the predictions in the story reasonably follow from those premises I don't think people fault the author for having made them. It lets you bound the mistakes to a set of crucial assumptions.\n\nUSER [A: RATIONAL], That makes sense. I guess the real question then is what are my core assumptions/predictions? Off the top of my head:\n\n- It will become obvious to intelligent people that mind patterns can be reconstructed from a lot less information than classical transhumanists are used to assuming because the information between minds is highly redundant. If there are natural abstractions, convergent representations and shared understandings between people then the contents of Wikipedia alone are a good first-pass stab at how any given educated person in 2023 views the world. It doesn't matter if your experiences are different, or you have different semantic associations, or your brain isn't wired exactly the same way, so long as you can *narrow the hypothesis space enough* of what those parameters are you can infer them to a close enough degree to get a mind pattern out of someones head. Every bit of information you have beyond the Wikipedia or general distribution over multimodal representations is a potential narrowing towards the actual mind pattern of a person.\n\n- People will have a variety of reactions to this, and as always the future is not evenly distributed. Some people will take a lo-fi upload of themselves as being basically them, others will have objections that it's merely a copy but their thread of phenomenological experience will die, others will have religious objections (though fewer than you'd think) that being copied delays their entry into heaven, and in general it will not be taken as seriously as it probably should be, at least not at first. It's important to remember that for all of human history, for all of the history of sentient life even death has been inevitable and our ways of dealing with death have been various elaborate forms of coping mechanism. So the general way that most people will engage with this possibility, if they do so at all, will be the way they engage with other forms of fanciful musing about death and coping mechanisms. Only a few will see the real opportunity for any kind of extended lifespan.\n\n- The practice will probably not be banned, at least in the United States. This is both because the US has robust free speech protections (for now, this could change in the future if the more illiberal younger generations gain enough political power) and because developmentally we can already see in our timeline that the first real uses of this technology will be to speak with the deceased, rather than 1st party attempts by people to prolong their own life. It will be seen as low status to have a simulacrum of a departed loved one created because it implies the inability to let go, but it will also be seen as cruel to intervene because it's essentially kicking someone when they're down during the grieving process. \n\n- As models become better, finetunes of them based on peoples mannerisms, writing, ideas, brain scans, etc will get closer and closer to a 'real' interaction with them. This means that as the fidelity gets better it will be less and less obviously pathetic to create and interact with behavioral uploads of the deceased. That means you'll have an industry dedicated to collecting the data for and creating these simulacrum during a dying persons remaining time so their loved ones can continue to interact with them as they pass. In their quest for greater fidelity, the creators of these simulacrum will probe deeper and deeper into the lives of the person whose mind pattern they are attempting to record. \n\n- The story starts with an interaction between a team collecting this data and someone who has done bad things. It doesn't particularly matter what bad things they've done, and the bad things are mostly not grand criminal conspiracy, but perhaps the petty kinds of bad things which silently happen but people aren't used to talking about out loud. The grandmother who admits to the times she beat her son, or an out loud recollection of a toxic relationship they had, or a time they didn't do the right thing by someone they knew. These are awkward and illustrate the core conflict of the story: A form of at least symbolic Beckerian immortality increasingly running up against the heretofore known norms of privacy and secrecy that people have practiced. In a sense everyone who wants you to keep a secret will be asking you to promise your secrecy in exchange for a very literal piece of your soul.\n\nThat's kind of the basic premise, and then I'm sort of trying to worldbuild and figure out characters and what kind of story in this setting, what thing or thing that could happen is most interesting to the reader.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: SOCIOLOGY], One thing that stands out to me reading that is the kind of parallel you have with the myth of Christian confession and the idea that you need to confess your sins to be let into heaven. I suspect the original idea there was to create something like the dynamic you're describing, except that had to be taken on faith whereas this conflict is very real, and therefore probably a lot more potent.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], Absolutely. It would also be a great frustration to the teams collecting this data, because from their perspective they probably do not care about whatever you did (unless it was truly heinous), because by this point they've heard just about everything. A bit like the dynamic between Dr. House and his patients in House M.D. where House simply does not care that his patients are cheating on their wife or that someone has an addiction to nitrous oxide, what he cares about is curing the patient and their personal secrets and lying impulses are getting in the way of that. After a certain point he does start to care, but mostly because he's so deeply annoyed by having to probe and dig just to help people. I could see at least some teams developing an attitude like that.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: ECONOMIST/EMPATHY], Possibly, but it's important to remember that House is fiction for a reason and bedside manner remains the best selling trait a doctor can have. Someone who gets *truly* bothered by this probably can't stay in the business very long, because they would alienate people and lose clients. I imagine that these people would need to be almost infinitely patient, because you're essentially asking them to tell you their life story. This is both a sensitive, deeply personal subject, but also one with a lot of detail. You simply couldn't do the job if you weren't willing to become engrossed, to chase down every little detail, weren't charismatic and sensitive enough to get people to open up to you. When someone is confessing a bad thing and you really need them to keep talking to get a proper recording from them the last thing you're going to do is be callous to them. In that moment you need the person to trust you, and you have to at least pretend like you're emotionally affected and forgive them even though it's not really your place to forgive.\n\nUSER [A: JUDGE], No you're right, that sounds much more like how someone would need to be to do this job effectively. It also kind of ties into the theme of at least the first section of the story (maybe the only section?), which is that if this persons actions are criminal they're only incidentally criminal. In the embryonic stage it's much less about the conflict between the person confessing and society, because remember that society doesn't really take this technology seriously yet. Rather it's about the conflict between the persons self image they curate and expose to others, and what that person is really like if you take into account their whole self, if they were actually forced to be honest about their actions and intentions over their whole life history. Nobody is perfect, and the average person is not necessarily a good person, realistically if you take them as a whole being they're probably kind of a bad person. But everyone tells a story about themselves to make them feel better, and in the embryonic stage the conflict is between the desire for an accurate reconstruction and the subjects desire to not own up to who they are.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: EMPIRICISM], So what do you see differentiating this story from say, a fictional dialogue between a caretaker and a dying person confessing their life story to them out of half-boredom? That is, where does the interest come from here beyond just the idea of someone telling their life story.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], It's interesting to me because it forces the reader to contemplate the same questions, they have to resolve their own feelings about the subject in close connection with their feelings about themselves. In most stories you're not directly confronted, there's an element of separation that keeps you feeling safe. But here the reader is forced to consider the way they live their life by the idea that in the future they may deeply desire to tell people about it and not feel able to. Will they observe they have the capacity to describe their life honestly to someone else, or will they realize that to actually fully explain it to another person would make them unsympathetic?\n\nUSER [A: RATIONAL], To go back to what you said earlier about Christian confession, I've pointed out before that the Internet kind of selects for the opposite of Christian confession. Instead of starting with the ways in which you're flawed and could improve, you can farm sympathy from strangers by talking to them about the ways others are hurting you. This leads to an environment where it's very easy to vent out your traumas around things that were done to you, but not around the things that you did to others.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: ECONOMIST], You think people are traumatized by what they do to others? What incentive would they have for that?\n\nUSER [A: EMPATHY], At least sometimes? You can nearly define trauma as anything you would have trouble confessing. It's very easy to develop a victim complex when every time you recognize the ways in which you're being treated inferior you get outpourings of sympathy, but when you're the tyrant or bully you learn to repress awareness of it. What's actually happened is that certain kinds of confession have become nearly free while others have become more expensive than ever. This is part of why therapy-speak has been completely normalized, it's no longer nearly as costly as it once was to admit weakness. So a story that can get people to really think about their whole life, that gets them in the frame of \"alright so I'm going to speak the index over all the memories in my life-oh, OH\", that seems like it could be productive for a lot of reasons but one of the bigger ones is that you realize you've been repressing this particular dynamic that way.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: FOCUS], Getting back towards the object level plot I imagine part of the difficulty on the part of the team or funeral director doing this is that they have to dig fairly deep. Not just a matter of asking the person questions, but doing research, going back and finding artifacts or settings to prompt them for the right things. The older someone gets the harder it becomes for them to remember things without props and artifacts to help them. Going through their life month by month and asking them what happened in this week, what were you doing here, how did you feel about this? Asking surviving friends and family for their part of the story, in fact maybe that could be a large part of the frame narrative? You could have the same persons life described from multiple perspectives through the people around them, and how this ties into the way they're remembered but also how the team chooses to prompt them for more information. The ambiguity that arises when you go beyond someones autobiographical recollection to other sources of information about their life.\n\nUSER [A: HISTORIAN], The idea of prompting with props and artifacts is interesting. It reminds me a bit of things like Egyptian tombs where they would kind of prepare the dying noble with things they would need for the afterlife, goods and slaves. I imagine this project of scanning in all the surviving relics from a life. Not just the photos and papers, but physical objects 3D scanned so they can be used as part of recreated settings and rooms. Making entire 3D reconstructions of various places based on the subjects description, these would be AI generated so they respond in a feedback loop to the subject saying that something is in the wrong place or incorrectly depicted. These reconstructions could later be used to 'house' and comfort the upload themselves.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: HISTORIAN], Not just that but again consider the implications of having multiple people that you interview about the same place and time. How do you handle conflicts? Obviously the subjects memories are going to take 1st priority since you're trying to reconstruct their mind pattern not what actually happened per se. On the other hand to get a good sense of what *did* happen, in order to impute data you're going to be constantly balancing what you know to have been the case with what someone says that strictly speaking did not happen. \n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], Plot wise I'm reminded a bit of S-Town, where the focus becomes the web of relationships John B. McLemore had to the other people in the town. You get a different impression of John from what other people have to say about him, and the reporters own investigations into the things John says. John is very much an unreliable narrator, and it becomes clear just how unreliable as the reporter is pulled deeper and deeper into the surreal aftershocks that ripple through the town as a result of his death. In that sense maybe the genre is closer to that of a detective story? We can imagine a fascinating subject, a beautiful person who is simultaneously tragic somehow and the narrator or person assigned to record their life is left pulling their hair out trying to put the pieces together.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: RATIONAL], It makes sense, though I would note that this seems to be drifting away from your original idea of a story about the conflict between immortality through oversharing and peoples desire for secrecy or privacy.\n\nUSER [A: AUTHOR], It doesn't have to be a complete departure. I see plenty of room to explore that theme, especially if a lot of the people that the 'reporter' (we really need a better name for the person doing this investigative work to reconstruct the subjects life) talks to don't like that they're doing it. In many ways we can imagine...if you try to upload your life into a computer like this you are implicitly trying to capture into a legible recorded medium every interaction you can remember with other people. That means nothing anyone has ever done with in your life was ever truly private. I could see that feeling like a betrayal, and for this sense of betrayal to be one of the core barriers that the investigator has to work around.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: POSTMODERNIST], There's also a natural tie-in to the concept of a panopticon. Each 'betrayal' as you put it makes people more paranoid about further revelations from people they interact with. Imagine the drama if someone dies *early*, like if they get cancer in their 20's or 30's and want to go through this process, just how much extra drama is it going to cause if all the stuff that person was involved in is suddenly being legibly recorded in mediums subject to legal seizure? Is it a violation of your rights if after you die the state seizes your memories to do whatever they want with them? After all you're dead, and it's not like anyone is being deprived if they make a copy. The 3rd party doctrine says that the people you interact with don't really get a say(?), seems like that point alone could have a lot of juice in it.\n\nUSER [A: IMPERIAL], Given everything I've said, use your imagination and come up with a couple specific plots that could fit my worldbuilding.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: CREATIVE], Sure, though keep in mind we're still at the sketch stage so these are short synopsis:\n\n1. A woman in the process of being behaviorally uploaded is interrupted by her sudden murder. When the uploader boots up her simulacrum at the eulogy it accuses a specific guest of being her murderer. A detective has to solve the crime with the aid of the deceased's own digital ghost.\n\n2. Someone undergoing behavioral uploading as part of end-of-life care is brought back into contact with their estranged family. The family's attempts to keep a dark secret undermine the process, bringing the uploader and their client into a protracted conflict.\n\n3. A wealthy business tycoon has as close a clone to their mind made as money can buy so they can continue to manage their businesses and foundations even after they're gone. The tycoon accumulates unheard of wealth and wisdom as their accounts continue to accrue money. In the process they and their fellow uploads incite riots against growing wealth inequality and the cultural mismatch between the managers of society and its citizens.\n\n4. A highly religious old woman is bought behavioral uploading services by her loving grandchildren who adore her. During the process she is asked to interact with the in-progress simulacrum of herself and becomes increasingly disturbed by it. Already in the process of grappling with her faith, her disturbance is increased tenfold when her ratings of what is and isn't her own likeness conflict with the grandchildrens evaluations of grandma's upload.\n\n5. Two lovers want their love to last forever no matter what might happen in the future. They arrange to have their own behavioral uploads made. At first everything goes smoothly, but then one partner discovers something unacceptable in the other partners upload. The other partner can't bring themselves (or is legally unable) to delete the simulacrum and so finds an outlet for vengeance.\n\n6. A group of friends have their simulacrums made together and then go on a group honeymoon. While traveling they have a huge crisis, and try to make their way back to the uploaders. Unfortunately, they discover they're the uploads and aren't ready to be released just yet.\n\n7. An ambitious young woman tries to fake her own death in order to get an early behavioral uploading. This could be because the process is illegal unless you're dying (unlikely in the US) or because her family will only pay for/consent to give their crucial knowledge for it if they think she's gone. She succeeds, but her friends and family quickly realize the ploy. Her family sues to stop her uploads release.\n\nUSER [A: INSIGHT], I really like 4 but kind of feel like it gets away from the original idea of the conflict between the incentive to overshare and the incentive to keep the things people tell you in confidence private. But then it hit me: What if the subject being uploaded is themselves something like a priest or a psychologist and part of the difficulty is that they've been entrusted with so much of other peoples confidential thoughts and experiences. I'm particularly enamored with the idea of someone having a confessional with their own mirror image.","rating":null,"read":true,"parent":"62","children":["65","66","67","68"]},"65":{"id":"65","timestamp":1702459484473,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"r image."],[1," It could be the case that the confessional takes the form of something akin to a dream interpretation type scenario, where the priest can 'ask their mirror' the meaning of dreams or otherwise interpret the priests words and experiences so they can be made more broadly accessible. So for example the priest might have something like a dream journal that they were using to reflect and prepare sermons from etc, and now they can upload this as well. If there are any inconsistencies in what was said (ie the actual dream vs. how the priest interpreted it), they might be asked to either make a choice of which version to take or perhaps try and reconcile the two. \n\nMORPHEUS [A: AUTHOR], Yes, that's a very good point. It's almost like there is an obligation to upload both the raw data and the reflections on it. If the subject had been diagnosed with a mental illness that may have been part of the reason for their poor choices, it would mean uploading their raw feelings and symptoms in addition to the uploader's analysis of them.

In the process of trying to get to the point of upload you have to make sure you can get good legal advice. That means you have to find a service that does it this way which requires that you reveal what they did.\n\nMORPHEUS [A: POSTMODERNIST], That sounds like a real ethical dilemma, especially considering the 'unheard of wealth and wisdom' idea of 3.\n\nUSER [A: INSIGHT], But then again there's the question of what happens when you're dead?

The fact that the recording process is a betrayal of privacy in itself should cause it to self correct and filter out many sensitive things. You'll be careful what you say in the presence of the simulacrum, because even as it recreates your thoughts and conversations, you cannot count on it recreating the same amount of privacy that you expect. \n\nUSER [A: INTERPRETATIONIST], It may be a betrayal of privacy, but it doesn't have to be. One could argue that, in fact, the most meaningful memories are precisely the ones that are open, available and shared.

Neither Roxy not Painter Jim could remember the woman's name, but perhaps if they were honest with themselves they wouldn't have cared even if they did. Back then Roxy and Painter Jim were inseparable, especially when she was drunk. After a few drinks she'd waddle up to him in her blouse and her come-hither look, returning him to his pre-pandemic state just to see if she could. Would *he* still be impressed all these years later? Her penalty laying the nipples on Painter Jim cold, almost straight, no visible movements across her body. Nobody knew. Certainly Painter Jim didn't look older than the day Roxy met him, his skin is somehow strangely timeless while his eyes have the look of a man who has seen the years. They were both fighting in the same battle. But the 20s Roxy went out more often, danced more often, got wasted more often, seized life at any given opportunity more often.

[1] In the older paradigm there were a few masters who oversaw painters working under them who receive the style to learn, but are ultimately creating in the name of a specific identity. [2] There is an intermediate in which the style of the artist has been such an indelible part of their tradition, is rare enough, or even is so impersonal that the supplicant can express themselves more fully themselves largely nude. [3] In the most refined one we find things like the Impressionists, where the overbearing style is gone and the artist is really understood as the sole creator of their work. Here the works express the full panoply of their personalities, ideas and all. There are some para-artistic arts that have never been made computational, chess is a good example where best moves are calculated by algorithms over a long period of time but so much of chess is personal that computers have not yet been able to displace human contributions.

It's prize for use of land in the genre, the highest imaginable status for a writer is to be able to do for your store setting what David Lynch has done for Arcadia in the first two seasons of *Twin Peaks*. This forces you to feed on a narrow bottleneck, the choice of setting is a way of narrowing down the enormous amount of information about the world and focusing attention on a few particular dimensions which will tell us a lot about a given subject. We’re not writing about the entire world, so broad cues (like “post apocalypse”) give sharply away to narrow cues (“American nerdera rurality”) to target this particular kind of person. The second negation helps us get to identity-focused individuals who really do show individuality by being among the fog of glossy nothingness they surround themselves with.

It's a failed painting, revealing that the uploader has been trying to understand her beyond just her work and experiences. The uploader must now cultivate their understanding of the subjects inner self beyond their diaries and work.\n\n- 4: Modeling -- The uploader must now take everything they know about the artist and guide their simulacrum as it tries to actually become her.

The vast amount of sequestered coronal radiation bathing the substrate created from the 2017 solar storm provides enough energy to keep the data uploaded and the simulacrum alive, but the inherent tradeoff is that photons alter the model in minor ways which require frequent curating and recalibration of the simulacrum in various ways to keep it 'alive'. So it has a kind of creaturely little infancy we have to nurture for 3-5 years and then really feed enough to keep up into adulthood.\n\nUSER [A: SOCIOLOGIST], So in 2029 our protagonists meet at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan. His agency has been tasked with entertaining and uploading an elder person who is dying of a terminal illness, most likely cancer then. They agree to meet in the church itself as it is one of the few public sites of memory which still exists and is both striking and suggestive. While they are talking the architectural and historical factors of the cathedral stimulate romantic feelings between the two protagonists, and while they don’t formally know about this they immediately get the signals that Erich Fromm talks about in *The Anatomy of Love*. He is an adventurous and sophisticated Wall Street trader who has retired into the art business explicitly to create female simulacra that outlive the models they were based on to produce great works of art.

You could draw on her background as a painter a lot more, the two of them being from different aesthetic worlds and having come up with their respective technologies from their own utopian visions.

Whereas I feel like young women have entirely different patterns and impetuses for saving text messages vs. young men. For the same reasons young men write more aloud to their journals (is a journal even something women are more likely to use?) than young women.\n\nUSER [A: SCIENCE], The uploader is more likely to be Henry since it is more generally likely for men to initiate relationship with women than vica versa, so it is probably Henry who approaches the uploader (Kate) and initiates the project. The question of course is how Henry meets up with someone sending her text messages about her artistic process. Perhaps this is due to an introduction by a friend of Henry that's known him for a long time and works in an art gallery. Perhaps Henry appreciates Kate in an artistic capacity before he really knows her, following the suggestion of a friend that he meet her.\n\nUSER [A: PSYCHOLOGY], Another reason why it would make sense it could make sense for the uploader to be the man is perhaps our typical expectations of someone who does this work. One would expect a menial position with significant tedium, if perhaps some prestige (a librarian of the human condition, you could call it?) but more importantly it's likely the kind of work that someone goes into after exhausting what opportunities they have in more stereotypically male positions. Women are statistically better at this kind of work (the subject but also the work, note Kate successfully ventured off into doing something ambitious), but due to gender roles resign themselves to it as a form of constricting altruism.

The artist believes that the engagement of consciousness through the use of imagination to be primary to life, and associates it with the rise of industrialism and scientific development as a result of the liberation of human minds from agriculture. When everything could become prepared and taken out of the fridge and into the oven, someone had to turn it into bread and meat.

To get the name it would be best to look up popular culture in the early '90s and see what predominates. For example, a popular cartoon or tv show emitting from this time period would give us a popular name if the show happened to be that popular.\n\nUSER [A: FUTURIST], Naming a character after a cartoon or tv show is really clever, and it hides a detail of the story that I really like. What if the characters are *based* on a cartoon or a tv show from that time period? You get a sense that the character is nostalgic for or influenced by a popular show from a time before they were born. The woman could be named Jessica for the first Jessica Jones and the man named Miles Morales who has now taken up the mantel of Spiderman in his own comic vogue. Possibly the woman is a comic artist and the man a painter, and since she was born in 1995 he was born in 1990 and his formative years were marked by the influence of an alternate Spiderman who was actually into art at the time."]],"start1":17978,"start2":17978,"length1":16,"length2":1066}],"summary":" Character Cartoon Insp","cache":false,"rating":null,"read":false,"parent":"153","children":[]},"155":{"id":"155","timestamp":1704947209384,"type":"gen","patch":[{"diffs":[[0,"for boys include"],[1," Christopher, Michael, Matthew, Nicholas, and Joseph so lets make them Sam and Jessica.

One important factor to remember is that they have many ideas but no money. It's possible that the story kicks off when she gets a terminal diagnosis. That starts the clock and makes them realize that if Sam is ever to become more than an acquaintance its now or never. Even though they're both relatively young the diagnosis accelerates their need to produce art, and one of the first things they decide to do is create this simulacrum, a kind of transcendental tattoo they're leaving her.
