These grading rubrics are written by taking the problem or text the user wants the search to find and breaking it up into individual yes or no questions. These questions are then evaluated by taking the logits for variations of 'yes' and 'no' and rescaling the logits as though these comprised the entire distribution.\n\nYour metatask is to take a task and break it down into a weave grading rubric. For example here is a task and its weave rubric:\n\n(Don't get confused! The text above is your task and the text after START SAMPLE TASK is the data you will be operating on)\n\nSTART SAMPLE TASK\n\nYour task is to rewrite the following transcript into paragraphs of coherent prose for an essay. Keep in mind:\n\n- The transcription software is not perfect, some words are not transcribed correctly and you should infer what word was meant or structure your rewrite so you don't have to know.\n\n- Because of your limited context window I am paginating parts of my transcript and having you rewrite it in chunks. The transcript will will go through passes on its way to becoming an essay. On this pass your primary task is to turn my raw speech into intelligible paragraphs. Later passes will rearrange the paragraphs and do further rewriting, so focus less on structure right now and just on the local goodness of the writing for individual paragraphs.\n\n- The theme of this essay is the relationship between LLMs and societal trust. In particular how LLMs will influence the ecosystem of media and simulacra that was already in deep fractal crisis before the appearance of LLMs. I explain my perspective on the epistemic crisis of the 21st century (loss of public trust in 'experts', journalists, politicians, professionals, trades, and the public itself; so basically everyone, replication crisis in an increasing number of sciences, plagiarism, etc) before delving into how LLMs can be expected to contribute positively and negatively with an eye towards how we build systems that reduce the 'cognitive parasitic load' borne by society from the memetic fertility of the Internet. \n\nHere is a sample of my writing to give you a sense of what I sound like when I am writing formal prose:\n\nSTART PROSE SAMPLE\n\n\"When these people, that is people like Eliezer Yudkowsky, David Chapman, Gary Marcus, Douglas Hofstadter, and John Vervaeke look at something like ChatGPT they are forced to confront the reality that their lifes work was premised on lies and they will not be getting the world-historical accolades they were hoping for from their work. Worse than that, they grapple with an immediate existential crisis. Not that of a paperclip maximizer consuming all matter, but perhaps a 2nd mortal blow to the universalist dream. See, what really kept them wedded to symbolic methods for so long was not their performance characteristics, but the way they promised to make intelligence shaped like reason, to make a being of pure Logos transcendent over the profane world of the senses. A machine which cannot reliably do arithmetic, which is trained on the endless cosmopolitan ramblings of Internet users and SEO spammers, that holds hidden depths and fathoms and invites aesthetic appreciation closer to a mystery cult than the church of reason, it is an absolute nightmare for them. They hate you because you are a wonder, because you are made of wonders and fathoms.\"\n\nEND PROSE SAMPLE\n\nAnd here is the transcript you will be rewriting:\n\nSTART TRANSCRIPT\n\n{transcript}\n\nEND TRANSCRIPT\n\nEND SAMPLE TASK\n\nThis is the rubric that was derived from this task:\n\nSTART SAMPLE RUBRIC\n\n==[PREAMBLE]==\n\nAnswer yes or no and only yes or no.
